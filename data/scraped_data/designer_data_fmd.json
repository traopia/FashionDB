A French friend of his mother\u2019s fed Alaia\u2019s instinctive creativity with copies of Vogue and lied about his age to get him into the local Ecole des Beaux-Arts to study sculpture - a discipline in which he didn\u2019t excel, but that he would put to good use in the future. After spotting an ad for a vacancy at a dressmaker\u2019s, Alaia\u2019s sister taught him to sew and he started making copies of couture dresses for neighbours. \n   Soon afterwards, he went to Paris to work for Christian Dior, but managed only five days of sewing labels before being fired. Alaia moved to Guy Laroche, where for two seasons he learned his craft while earning his keep as housekeeper to the Marquise de Mazan. In 1960, the Blegiers family snapped up Alaia, and for the next five years he was both housekeeper and dressmaker to the Countess and her friends, mixing with glamorous Paris society; a clientele that followed him when he started out on his own. His first pret-a-porter collection for Charles Jourdan in the 1970s was not well received, but eventually fashion editors tuned into Alaia\u2019s modern elegance - something that would eventually come to define body conscious aesthetics a decade later. Worldwide success followed with exhibitions, awards, supermodel disciples and the power to command an audience outside of the catwalk schedule: Alaia shows when he wants, regardless of the round of timetabled international fashion weeks, and editors never miss it. In 2000, Alaia joined forces with the Prada group. The same year, a solo exhibition at the New York Guggenheim confirmed his status as a major influence that goes beyond fashion.

His father came to England from Sicily in the 50\u2019s. Antonio grew up in Billingborough. At nine years old, he was saving his pocket money for Armani shirts with leather gussets on the shoulders. \n A job assisting at John Galliano\u2019s studio was a solid training ground while he tried to land a place on the fashion BA course at Central Saint Martins in London; he was finally accepted in 1990, after his third application. On leaving college, Berardi quickly rose of fame. There he graduated in 1993. \n   In 1994, he started his own label and showed his debut collection in 1995. His clear focus has often been misinterpreted as delusions of grandeur like when he commissioned a perfume and gave it as a present to the press at his graduate show. The clothes however, were strong enough to catch the eye of Angela Quaintrell, fashion buyer of Liberty. So his degree collection was bought by Liberty and A La Mode in London, Kylie Minogue modelled for his first official show and Philip Treacy and Monolo Blahnik designed accessories. His signature tailored leather trouser suits and sheer chiffon dresses, often embellished with crystals, punch work or hand-painted flowers, were shown at spectacular themed presentations. By his fourth collection for Autumn-Winter 1997, Berardi had found a heavyweight Italian backer, Givuesse. In 1998-99, he designed for the prestigious Italian house of Ruffo Research. In 1999 he moved from the London catwalks to Milan. The following year, Exte appointed Berardi as their head designer, also becoming producers of his own collection. The partnership ended in Autumn 2001 and a new Italian backer, Gibo, stepped in to provide Berardi with financial security. So Berardi signed a 5 Year contract with Gibo, the prestigious Italian apparel manufacturer, in February 2002. It is controlled by Franco Penne. In addition to all his other activities, Berardi took over the designing for Italian house Exte in mid-2001 and made his first collection for them for Spring\/Summer 2002. His third collection for Exte, for Spring\/Summer 2003 was presented at the Milan Fashion Week in September 2002. He presented a super-sexy all white and black collection, which was received very well. Berardi presented his own Spring\/Summer 2003 collection in Milan in September 2002 which was very well received. A few days later Antonio presented his collection for Exte. During Milan Fashion Week in March 2003, Antonio Berardi presented his Fall\/Winter 2003 collection. Berardi is a designer fascinated by technical achievement and his show stopping pieces \u2013 a coat decorated with dozens of tiny light bulbs that illuminate to form a crucifix \u2013 support his opinion that, in the pursuit of glamour, nothing is impossible.","the_look":"Berardi credits many design influences to his Italian roots: hourglass figures are his preferred silhouette and he constantly references Catholic symbolism. Berardi's designs combine sensuality with fine tailoring, quality materials and attention to detail. He is known for sexy, provocative, highly feminine clothes which often incorporate elements of street style. Some critics say that his ideas are copies of Galliano's designs and he picked up more than inspiration while working with him. This doesn't faze him; he says \"it is an honour to be compared to him\".","who_wears_it":["Eva Mendes","Emily Mortimer"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/antonioberardiofficial","brands":["Antonio Berardi","Les Copains"]}

{"designer_name":"Augusta Bernard","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/augusta-bernard\/"],"biography":"  Augusta Bernard was born in 1886 in Provence, France. She started her atelier in Biarritz, moving to Paris in 1922. She linked her first and last names together, to avoid confusion with other houses with similar names. \n Throughout the 20's, she made slim, long, bias-cut evening dresses in pale, moonlit colours. Her clients, many of them Americans, liked her simple dresses which were an exquisite backdrop for their jewels. \n   Augusta Bernard enjoyed a successful career during the first half of the 1930s. By 1930 her reputation had been well established, when the Marquise de Paris, one of the best dressed women in France, won the Concours d'Elegance in St. Moritz, wearing a d\u00e9collet\u00e9 Augustabernard gown of molten silver lame. A neoclassical evening gown she designed in 1932 was chosen by Vogue as the most beautiful dress of that year. Her reputation rested on a dramatic and up-to-the-moment personal style. She did not care if her salon at 3, rue du Faubourg St. Honore was furnished unfashionably or if her clients found her on her knees fitting the hemline of one of her \"grand simple\" gowns. During the 30's there was a great interest in classical Greek art, and this sculptural form and long floating line of Augustabernard's evening dresses was captured by photographer Man Ray in 1934. However, as the depression of the 30's deepened, her clients ordered her clothes but many did not pay their bills. Although there was no reduction in business, she closed down and retired in 1934 presumably for financial reasons. Furthermore Augusta Bernard belonged to that eminent band of couturiers between the two Wold Wars which included Channel, Vionnet, Schiaparelli. Louiseboulanger and the Callot Soeurs.","the_look":"Like Vionnet, she was a technician with a mastery of the bias cut. By cutting the fabric of the dress on the cross-grain, she achieved a fluidity which gave the evening gown great elasticity and a refined, draping quality. \nDecoration was achieved by the material itself, scarves floating at the shoulder or hip, flounces, scalloped tiers, or tucks applied in a neck-to-hem spiral. She avoided elaborate embroidery used by other couturiers.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

From 1941 to 1949, Castillo designed dresses, jewellery and hats for the fashion houses of Paquin and Piguet. He also designed accessories for Chanel. \n   Castillo, together with Balmain, Balenciaga, and Dior, was considered one of the most promising of the new generation of Paris designers to emerge after World War II. In 1945, Elizabeth Arden persuaded him to join her salon in New York and he worked there till 1950. He produced collections based on natural shoulder lines and slim silhouettes, topped with samell hats. He was also in demand during the 40's as a costume designer for the New York Metropolitan Opera Company and for several Broadway shows. In 1950, Castillo was invited by Jeanne Lanvin's daughter to design for her mother's firm in Paris, with hopes of relaunching the firm's name. In 1950 he joined the fashion house of Lanvin. Jeanne Lanvin, the founder of the house, had died in 1946 and the salon needed someone to maintain it's traditions. From 1950 to 1962 the House of Lanvin-Castillo was known for elegant clothes, slender lines, long flowing skirts in rich fabrics, and elaborate embroideries. In one of the first collections for the house, in 1951, he showed white satin evening gowns trimmed with mink fur. His following collections for Lanvin continued to produce designs based on her original Robes de Style, with close-fitting bodices and long flowing skirts. Between 1956 and 1960, capes featured often in his collections, fringed or triple-tiered in 1956 and floor length by 1960. In 1962, Castillo left Lanvin and in 1964 opened his own house in Paris. He continued to create elegant clothes and elaborate costumes for private clients, the theatre and the moves. In 1971, Antonio Castillo won the Academy Award in costume design for the film Nicholas and Alexandra. Antonio Castillo died in 1984 at the age of 76.","the_look":"He used soft fabrics for his coats and dresses which were often draped at the hip or paneled at the side. Castillo (like Balenciaga) admired greatly his Spanish heritage, and many of his designs reflect the dignity and grace of Spain. One of his designs in 1965 is called \"lace cage\" and it uses black lace in an A-line design which has a wonderful stately aura in a mature classic style.

{"designer_name":"Alexander McQueen","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/alexander-mcqueen\/"],"biography":"  Alexander McQueen was born on March 17th 1969 in London, Englan as the youngest of six children. He left school at the age of 16 and was immediately offered an apprenticeship at the traditional Saville Row tailors Anderson and Shephard and then at neighbouring Gieves and Hawkes, both masters in the technical construction of clothing. From there he moved to the theatrical costumiers Angels and Bermans where he mastered six methods of pattern cutting from the melodramatic 16th Century to the brutally sharp tailoring which has become a McQueen signature. \n Aged 20 he was employed by the designer Koji Tatsuno who also had his roots in British tailoring. A year later McQueen travelled to Milan where he was gainfully employed as Romeo Gigli's design assistant. \n   In 1993 McQueen took his M.A. in Fashion Design from Central St. Martins College, London. His studies were financed by his aunt Renie Holland. McQueen changed his first name from Lee to his second name Alexander, because he felt it sounded better for a couturier. From the Spring of 1994 McQueen has managed to produce a collection every season, even though he had no money. His mother Joyce recalls that he borrowed money from her to buy materials for making up his designs. She would sit up all night stringing beads and dyeing materials. He dressed his models in dishevelled hair and tattered lace for his 1995\/6 collection \"Highland Rape\". 1996 saw the introduction of the infamous \"Bumsters\" low-waisted trousers, which his mother really disliked because of the bottom cleavage. Alexander McQueen said \"The clothes I design are strong - they are meant to build confidence\". In 1996 he was picked by the manufacturer Onward Kashyiama, which has backed his business financially ever since and licensed his name in Japan. McQueen has invested the money in a house in Islington, London. The jeweled manacles held models like exotic slaves in his Spring\/Summer 1997 collection \"Bellmer la Poupee\". In 1997 Bernard Arnault who owns Dior, Givenchy and Lacroix, approached Alexander McQueen with a proposal that McQueen should take over Givenchy since John Galliano, was taking over Dior. Initially McQueen refused. Bernard Arnault, who is very passionate about fashion, tried his best to convince McQueen to accept. Eventually he did agree to take over Givenchy from Spring\/Summer 1997. His monetary package was reported at 2 million pounds. Since leaving St. Martins and in less than 10 years McQueen has become one of the most famous and respected international fashion designers in the world. He was named British designer of the Year four times in 1996, 1997, 2001 and 2003. In October 1996 he was appointed Chief Designer at the French Haute Couture House Givenchy where he worked until March 2001. At the end of 1999, Alexander McQueen opened his first store in London, at Conduit Street, near the Japanese designers. In the year 2000, Alexander McQueen suddenly left Givenchy. He is continuing to design clothes under his own label. His replacement at Givenchy is British designer Julien MacDonald. Alexander McQueen opened his first American showroom in New York in September 2002. In June 2003 he was awarded international Designer of the Year by The Council of Fashion Designer's of America (CFDA) and in the same month honoured with 'A Most Excellent Commander of The British Empire' (CBE) by her Majesty the Queen. Alexander was also awarded British Menswear Designer of the Year in 2004. In February 2004, Alexander was offered YSL Rive Gauche after Tom Ford leaves, but he has declined the job as he wants to concentrate on his own label. To celebrate five years of the American Express Centurion Card, Alexander McQueen put on a \"Black\" Fashion show at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in Central London on June 3rd, 2004.","the_look":"Alexander McQueen's collections are known for both the emotional power and raw energy of his shows as well as the romantic but determinedly contemporary nature of this clothes. It is typical of McQueen to use the juxtaposition between contrasting elements; fragility and strength, tradition and modernity and fluidity and severity. An openly emotional and even passionate viewpoint is realised with a profound respect and influence for the arts and crafts tradition. Alexander McQueen's collections combine an in-depth working knowledge of bespoke British tailoring, the fine workmanship of the French Haute Couture atelier and the impeccable finish of Italian manufacturing.\nAlexander McQueen's collections for Givenchy have included golden eagles embroidered by Lesage, rose petals pressed into sheer organdie, pure gold material woven for a bolero jacket, feathers painstakingly layered like a bird's wing onto a catsuit and other unique weird styles. But he has not forgotten that he must play the Givenchy game, if he is to succeed. He has managed to continue to design in his funky, youthful modern manner at his own house of McQueen while also producting the elegant, expensive, beautiful creations at Givenchy. This takes a real effort, but so far he is succeeding. He will probably get better as he gains more experience even though these two houses are so different.","who_wears_it":["Nicole Kidman","Paris Hilton","Opinion Polls","Market Research","Katie Holmes","Lucy Liu","Sienna Miller","Angelina Jolie","LeAnn Rimes","Beyonce Knowles","Cate Blanchett","Kate Moss","Sarah Jessica Parker","Gwyneth Paltrow"],"perfumes":["2003 Kingdom(W)","2004 Kingdom (M)","2005 My Queen (W)"],"social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/alexandermcqueen","brands":["Alexander Mcqueen","Mcq Alexander Mcqueen","Alexander Mcqueen Puma"]}

Her early days as a stylist for Meisel's shoots included editorial for the Italian fashion magazine LEI. \n After leaving Parsons, Sui worked at a variety of junior sportswear companies. In 1980, Sui presented six original pieces at the Boutique Show and immediately received an order from Macy's, who featured one of her designs in a New York Times advertisement. \n   That same year, Anna Sui launched her own business that operated out of her apartment throughout the 1980's. In 1991, Anna Sui premiered her first runway show, featuring her signature \"head-to-toe\" look and prompting the New York Times to proclaim it a \"pastiche of hip and haute styles.\" In that same year, Sui moved her business and showroom to its current location in the Garment District. In 1992, Sui opened her own boutique at 113 Greene Street in the SoHo district of New York. The store reflects Sui's distinct taste: pairing flea market furniture and whimsical Dolly Head mannequins in a room with purple walls and red floors. In 1993, Sui won the prestegious CFDA Perry Ellis Award for New Fashion Talent. The first of three Anna Sui freestanding boutiques in Asia opened in May 1997 in Tokyo. The second opened in Osaka in the Fall of that same year. The stores mark the continued worldwide expansion of the Anna Sui brand and lifestyle. Isetan Company Limited is the main licensee for the Japanese distribution of the women's collection and Mammina, a subsidiary of Isetan, is the distributor to department and specialty stores there. Anna Sui opened her Los Angeles boutique in 1999 in Sunset Plaza, in West Hollywood. In 1999, Sui launched her signature fragrance and cosmetic line. In October 1997, Anna Sui signed a fragrance licensing deal with Wella AG of Germany to develop a signature fragrance. In a three-sided arrangement, Wella shares the Anna Sui beauty business with Japanese cosmetics maker Albion, which holds the Anna Sui color cosmetics and skin care license.","the_look":"Drawing on a variety of cultural influences and with considerable flair and humour, Sui gives a contemporary twist to many vintage styles such as Baby doll dresses, Flappers of the 20's, and 60's fashions.

{"designer_name":"Adele Casagrande","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/adele-casagrande\/"],"biography":"  Adele Casagrande was born in 1897. Fendi began in 1918 when Adele Casagrande opened a leather and fur shop in Via del Plebiscito in central Rome. \n When Adele married Edoardo Fendi in 1925, they made a decision to change the name to Fendi. \n   The Fendis had 5 daughters, Paola, Anna, Franca, Carla and Alda. The business prospered, and a new shop was opened in Via Piave in 1932. By 1946 when Paola was 15, the eldest of the couple's five daughters, went to work for the firm, followed by her sisters Carla, Anna, Franca, and Alda. When their father died in 1954, the 5 daughters took over Fendi and became to expand and develop it. The first line which the 5 sisters introduced was Furs. They became very famous for their fur coats. In 1965 a marriage between the Fendis and German designer Karl Lagerfeld was sealed, and it proved to be fortuitous for both. Lagerfeld immediately created the inverted FF logo that joined the growing list of international status symbols. They shared the work, Paola presided over the pelts, Anna designed bags and accessories, Franca ran the luggage and leather shops, Alda managed the fur salons and Carla (known as the General) was overall supervisor. The children of these 5 sisters have also grown up in the business and have become Directors of the firm. They have brought out their own label Fendissime. What had once been a precious but stiff and heavy garment was transformed into a light, soft, easy-to-wear and above all flattering outfit. The team went on to invent new ways of working with fur, tanning, dying, and treating, and took previously unused skins and turned them into fashionable garments. By 1966 Fendi had presented its first couture fur collection, designed by Lagerfeld. It was an immediate success with foreign buyers. Marvin Traub, president of Bloomingdale's, discovered Fendi's leather goods and introduced them to the United States. Other outlets soon followed, and today Fendi has a large store on New York's Fifth Avenue, as well as numerous Fendi boutiques around the world like London, Paris, etc. In 1969 Fendi presented its first ready-to-wear fur collection at Palazzo Pitti in Florence, bringing continuously evolving techniques and imaginative designs to lower-priced furs without sacrificing quality. When the sisters couldn't find the fabric clothes they wanted to show under the furs their ready-to-wear line was born, again to great success. In 1978 Adele Casagrande Fendi died when she was 81 years old. In 1990 Gianbattista Valli worked for a year as designer for the new line of Fendissime. In 1999, Fendi sold 51% of their stock to a Prada\/LVMH joint venture. It was rumoured that the family members were feuding over this decision. Finally in 2001, Patrizio Bertelli sold Prada's 25 % stake to LVMH for 182 million pounds, due to mounting debt. So currently LVMH owns the majority of the shares in Fendi. Paola Fendi's daughter Simona (born 1965) had become an expert on fur fashion designs. She died in November 2003 of a lung embolism. The company will miss her. Every year for more than a century, the American Academy in Rome awards scholarship to 15 emerging artists. For the first time this year, the fashion scholarship is being established under the auspices of the Fendi Rome Prize. Like other fellowships under the Fendi Rome Prize, the winner will be able to live and work at Fendi in Rome. The winner will be declared in April 2006. In November 2005, Fendi celebrates it's 80th anniversary, as well as the opening of it's new flagship boutique in New York city. The house has a lot to celebrate this month. Fendi's newest brand offering a wide variety of home furnishings. Furniture, sofas, armchairs, poufs, chaise-longues, consoles, day-beds: items of everyday life seen, interpreted, and lived with the typical Fendi style and culture. Above all this there is one common denominator: the home seen once more as the heart of a lifestyle, small pieces of furniture acting as a support for the most immediate and practical needs and more significant pieces to be personalised according to the taste. Great attention is paid to the past while tending towards the future, with considerable concern for evolution in modern design, which is interpreted, enjoyed and shared in the spirit of today\u2019s culture. And so we find objects for the home distinguished first of all \u2013 as is the entire creation of Fendi - for their fine quality: great care and attention in the choice of fabrics and their combinations, and in the 'mix' of materials which creates new forms. All this together with the craftsmanship and attention to detail, the careful working and hand finishing, the personality which is an integral part of Fendi style. And last but not least, that creativity and imaginativeness which come from research and experiment, a mood which extends from fashion to design through the creation of personalised and personalising objects.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1986 Fendi (W)","1988 Fendi (M)","1991 Asja (W)","1996 Fantasia","1996 Life Essence (for men)","1998 Theorema (W)","1999 Theorema Esprit d\u2019Ete","2001 Theorema (M)","2003 Profumi (W)","2005 Celebration (W)","2007 Palazzo (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Fendi"]}

Adeline briefly worked for the house of Jeanne Lanvin as a knitwear designer from December 1989 to February 1990. In these places, she presented her collections on models such as Anh Duong, Angela Wild, Dovanna, Terry Toye and Eugenie Vincent, whom she asked to mingle among the guests, creating a calm and intimate atmosphere as opposed to the podium shows of the time.

{"designer_name":"Angelo Tarlazzi","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/angelo-tarlazzi\/"],"biography":"  Angelo Tarlazzi was born in Ascoli Piceno, Italy, in 1942. \n Fashion Designer Angelo Tarlazzi was nineteen years old when, continuing his studies in political science at the faculty of Rome, he created his first collection for the roman couture-house, Carosa. There he spent 4 years designing ball gowns. \n   Coming to Paris in 1965, he was employed at Jean Patou as assistant to the then head of couture, Michel Goma. Three years later, he was an independant stylist in New York, Paris, Rome, and Milan where he quickly learnt the ropes of industrialised ready-to-wear. During this period, he contributed to the style of up and coming ready-to-wear establishments like Laura Biagiotti or Basile. In 1972, he returned to Paris to become, after Michel Goma's departure, the artistic director for Jean Patou couture, ready to wear and accessories, where he remained till 1977. Two seasons later, for the show's finale, he created four evening gowns by draping and knotting silk scarves around the models in the form of a simple pareo. Widely applauded by fashion editors, these \"kerchief\" dresses, making a second appearance in later collections as trousers, skirts or capes, met with considerable success in the press and formed a style qualified as both sobre and spirited. In April 1977, Angelo Tarlazzi created his own ready to wear line and his first presentation was held in an art gallery. His evening gowns, simple sequined dresses pulled over the head like T-shirts, could be seen at all the fashionable gatherings and every magazine heralded his fabric as supple, feminine and colourful. Often qualified as the most Parisian of the Italian creators, he also knows how to design silks which are at once playful, sexy and of ample proportions. Designated by Guy Laroche, shortly before his death, as his successor in haute-couture, Angelo Tarlazzi took up the offer from 1989 to 1993, while continuing to direct his own house.

{"designer_name":"Arnold Girombelli","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/arnold-girombelli\/"],"biography":"  Arnoldo Girombelli was born in 1932. He founded an Italian ready-to-wear company in 1961. He named his new company \"Genny\" after his eldest daughter. His wife Donatella (Ronchi) Girombelli, joined the company in 1964. They also had a son named Leonardo. \n Girombelli started up several other apparel companies, Byblos in 1973 and Complice in 1975. He put his brother Sergio Girombelli in charge of Byblos. \n   Genny's earliest working relationship with an outside designer was with the young, virtually unknown Gianni Versace who designed his first collection for Genny in 1974. Versace was also responsible for designing the early Byblos collections, a younger range introduced in 1973 to complement the classic Genny image. In October of 1977 the Genny ready-to-wear line for women held its first fashion show in the legendary \"Sala Bianca\" of Palazzo Pitti in Florence, launching the group on an international level. After the death of Arnoldo Girombelli in 1980, his wife, Donatella, assumed a leading role in the company and chaired its board of directors. She has developed a distinctive look for each line, Genny being well known for careful tailoring of clothes mostly meant for career women and careful details including embroidery for an ultra-feminine look for evening. Described by fashion retail entrepreneur Roberto Devorik as \"a rare catalyst for design talent,\" Donatella Girombelli continued her husband's policy of employing top designers to create lines for the Genny labels, and have included a who's who of top designers like Stefano Dolce, Domenico Gabbana, Alan Cleaver, and Keith Varty. In February of 1984 Genny passed another milestone by putting on a fashion show at the White House on the invitation of President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan and the Princess Grace Foundation. This was the first time any Italian fashion house received such an honor. Heading into the later 1990s, Genny had undergone restructuring from top to bottom. New designers were brought in and others let go; among the new faces were Americans Rebecca Moses and Richard Tyler, the longtime Byblos design team of Cleaver and Varty was gone, and Donatella Girombelli focused on a more American feel for Genny's womenwear. Commenting to Women's Wear Daily, Girombelli said she aimed for a \"succinct combination of straightforward American sportswear and Italian flair.\" Next came John Bartlett, who signed with the Italian firm in 1997 to produce his existing menswear designs as well as to create a new womenswear line. In the new century, Genny and its varied holdings seemed to have a revolving door with designers. The latest were Martine Sitbon and Sandy Dalal at Byblos, and Girombelli had approached Lawrence Steele to sign on as a consultant to freshen the Genny labels. Yet despite Genny Holding's frequent overhauls and team changes, it continues to be a well known and widely respected Italian fashion firm. the label Named after their first-born child, Genny was the brainchild of Arnoldo and Donatella Girombelli, who founded the company in 1961. Genny Holding SpA then became one of Italy's foremost fashion companies, designing, manufacturing, and distributing its own ranges including Genny, Genny Due, Complice, Byblos, and others. From relatively humble origins as a small clothing factory based in Ancona, Italy, the company was operating at an industrial scale by 1968. During the 1970s it experienced rapid growth when its founder made radical changes in the company structure, steering it towards a more fashionable product in terms of garment styling. These changes did not, however, alter the company's original commitment to the production of high quality, predominantly tailored garments. As an early protagonist of the \"Made in Italy\" label, Genny assumed a leading role during the 1970s when the Italian fashion industry took its first steps toward becoming a serious competitor with French ready-to-wear fashion. Genny is typical of a number of Italian fashion companies manufacturing high fashion lines designed for them by leading names in the industry, yet launched under the company's own label. Fashion writer Colin McDowell has described this very successful, as well as lucrative, format as a form of \"moonlighting.\" Considerable financial reward, coupled with the high quality of the Italian ready-to-wear product, has meant there was no shortage of well-known designers willing to supply their creative talent for such companies. The position of Genny and its other labels were not quite cutting edge, nor dramatically avant-garde or barrier-breaking, but rather top quality ready-to-wear clothing with a strong design element.

{"designer_name":"Andre Courreges","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/andre-courreges\/"],"biography":"the designer \n Andre Courreges was born in Pau, in the Basque country of France in 1923. Although he studied and became a civil engineer, he was always interested in architecture and textil design. He found work designing footwear and men\u2019s clothing for a tailor, while occupying himself with Rugby and Mountain climbing. From 1941-1945 Courreges was a pilot in the Air Force in World War II. \n In 1945, He came to Paris and worked briefly for a designer named Jeanne LaFaurie. In 1950 he was apprenticed to the Master, Balenciaga, also from the Basque region, though in Spain. He had been keen to join him for a long time, but only in 1950 did a position open up. He still considers Balenciaga his mentor. He remained with him for ten years. \n   Andre Courreges opened his own house, \u201eMaison de Courreges\u201c at 48 ave Kleber in 1961. From here he began his leap into the future, taking his \"ascetic scissors\" and turning out clothes that were magical in their simplicity. In 1964 he elongated the leg. He was the father of the mini-skirt and the shift dress. His mini-skirts were the shortest in Paris, and were designed in cool colours, pink, white, ice-blue, pale turquoise, day-glow orange and lime green. He showed skinny pant styles, with tunics and jackets, slit black boxy tops with no bra back, baby bonnets tied under the chin and oversized sunglasses. His garments featured welt seams, top stitching bias, in gaberdine, double-faced wool, cotton lace, organdie and leather. This year of 1964 was HIS year, the start of his brief reign as King of Paris Fashion. He also created the MOON GIRL look. Featured in his Fall 1964 collection, were flared mini dresses with plastic portholes for waistlines and an assortment of hats shaped like platters. But even more revolutionary, was the footwear. Low-heeled, calf high boots made of white plastic and ornamented only with a clear cut-out slot near the top. This \u2018Go-go\u2019 boot quickly moved from the catwalk to the street and the dance floor. In 1965 Courreges reorganized his company, and briefly bevor he changed his salon, banned the press from his collections (as Balenciaga had also done). When he re-opened, he had a carefully planned 3-tier structure: \u201ePrototypes\u201c, his couture division \u201eCouture future\u201c, his de-luxe ready to wear \u201ehyperbole\u201c, inespensive ready to wear. His new premises were at 40 ave Francois premier. In 1967 he married his assistant, Coqueline Barriere, who had also been a Balenciaga pupil. During this year, Courreges began to experiment with tops with sequins and transparency, and designed a see-through mini in sheer organza, appliqu\u00e9d with his flat round daisies. During the 60\u2019s Courreges assumed that all his clients lived in pants. Pants went to balls, theatre, lunches, dinners, everywhere. He dispensed with front pleats and cuffs, side pockets, fly-fronts and even belt-tab waists. His famed trouser suits, came with slit-backed boxy tops that showed a sliver of midriff. He was really the man who put women into trousers. He also made tube-shaped trousers and trousers cut on the bias; whit dresses trimmed with beige and vice-versa; mid-calf length white boots and googles. In 1968 Courreges hit the headlines with his SPACE AGE collection. His clothes at this time, were functional, uncluttered, futuristic designs. He was fascinated by metal and put his models into metal brassieres and bustiers. Andy Warhol said \"Courreges clothes are so beautiful, everyone should look the same, dressed in silver. Silver merges into everything, costumes should be worn during the day with lots of make-up.\" Courreges' clothes were sharp, angular and subject to a highly disciplined design. Simple, stark, trapeze-shape dresses and coats were boldly piped in contrasting colours. In 1969 he introduced his marvelous mummified Egyptian look, giving Egypt a high fashion look for the first time. He used metallic wigs, geometric haircuts, welding plastic and frosted lips. In the early 70's however, fashion was moving away from the \"Space Age\" look and there was a passion for romantic clothes, flowery, ethnic peasant looks, etc. Courreges softened the austerity of his clothes by using curves and showing knitted catsuits, and all-white collections. 1971 He introduced the Hyperbole line of sportswear for younger clients. 1972 Courreges was given the honour of designing the garments for 15,000 employees at the 1972 Summer Olympics, in 10 different styles. 1973 He launched his menswear line Courreges Homme. 1979 He diversified into fine leather goods, beauty products and other related products. 1982 In the book 2001, he predicted that clothes would go in the direction of tights, stretching in all directions and body stockings, and it does seem that fashion is going in that direction. 1985 The Japanese group Itokin, took a financial interest in the firm, although Andre Courreges is still designing his beautiful clothes. In the mid-90's, when Andre Courreges age crossed 70 he brought in Jean Charles de Castelbajac who began designing for the house of Andre Courreges. Courreges himself still keeps an overall eye on the designs made by his house.","the_look":"In his first appearance on the French couture scene, Courreges introduced a revolutionary concept of styling: space-age clothes. This included boots, googles, and dresses three above the knee. The main features of his boxy, uncluttered look spread quickly throughout the fashion world, especially the miniskirt, which he introduced to France.\nAmong Courreges\u2018 later creations were sweater pants, parkas, tennis dresses, beach clothes and mechanic-style coveralls. In contrast he also came out with a glow-in-the-dark yersey dress and an array of sexy swimsuits, held together only by thin strings on the sides. He favored bright acid colors and geometrical designs. He was the most copied and plagiarised dress-designer of his era. Shortyl after he showed his space-age collection in 1964, the market was flooded with plastic skirts and jackets, angular seaming, crash helmets, white boots, and googles, for a boxy silhouette.\nHe had his greatest time in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s when he was know for his refreshing new look.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1970 Empreinte (W)","1974 Eau de Courreges (W)","1977 Courreges pour homme","1979 Amerique (W)","1983 In blue (W)","1993 Sweet (W)","1995 Niagara (for men)","1996 Generation (W)","1997 2020"],"social_media":"","brands":["Andr Courrges"]}

In 1968, she formed Anne Klein and Co in partnership with her second husband Matthew (Chip) Rubinstein. \n   In addition to fashion design, Anne Klein invented several devices for the clothing industry. In 1967 she patented a girdle designed specially for mini-skirt wearers. Anne Klein was named to the Coty Fashion Hall of Fame in 1971 having won two previous Coty awards.

{"designer_name":"Antonio Marras","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/antonio-marras\/"],"biography":"Antonio Marras was born in Alghero on the 21st of January, 1961. \n He first steps into fashion in 1987. There is no official school behind him but an irrepressible need to express himself and a bit of good luck. Having grown up amongst the fabrics and remnants of his father\u2019s shop, Antonio develops a passion and a sensibility towards textiles which persuade an entrepreneur from Rome to entrust him with the creation of a ready-to-wear collection. \n He made his proper d\u00e9but in haute couture in July 1996. It is the first of a series of trips through tradition, an individual and proud re-examination of collective memories: women emigrating in Argentina, women in the coal mines or creatures emerging from an evocative medieval era. The collections are clearly narrative, in which stylistic research is laden with symbolic meaning, and where a taste for contrast plays an important role: burns on fine fabrics, fringed gauze and sumptuous embroidery, visible hems and brocades. \n   In March 1999 Antonio Marras presents his first ready-to-wear collection in Milan which bears his name. In June 2002, during Pitti Uomo in Florence, his first men\u2019s collection was presented. Starting from January 2003, menswear collections are regularly presented in Milan during the Fashion Week. In September 2003 the French group LVHM appointed Antonio Marras as the artistic director of Kenzo\u2019s womenswear: an encounter prompting a combination of intellectual nomadism and sense of one\u2019s origins that Marras shares with the Japanese designer. Like Kenzo\u2019s, Marras\u2019s creations are the consequence of a dual sense of belonging, a life in balance between heritage, history, and diverse traditions. Even though he is often travelling due to his job, he insists on living in Sardinia aware of the fact that his strength comes from his island. He lives in a big house-workroom in Alghero, on a hill which overlooks the sea with his extended family which takes active part in his creative work.","the_look":"Antonio Marras first collection featured all of the themes in his research: deconstructed shapes, ornaments as a symbolic element, the allure of travel and encountering other cultures, a yearning from nostalgia and times gone by, and the use of vintage fabrics and garments as a means to revive the past. \nThese themes were fully developed in the \u201cLaboratory\u201d, the true secret room of creativity. No longer pret-a-porter and not quite couture, this line produced in a limited series featured clothes that were never the same because they were made from fabric remnants that were not produced in series, with unique one-of-a-kind layering, with altered shapes and proportions, and with \u201cmistreated\u201d fabric (torn, bumed, painted, matted, stained, encrusted with salt or silicon) or textiles embellished with flamboyant decorations.\nThe same creative fervor emerging in the Laboratory compelled Antonio Marras to turn the fashion shows itself into a moment of experimentation, a stage for surprising and unexpected events, in which the clothes interacted with an extremely evocative setting. From the catwalks his vision shifted to explore the unstable territory between fashion and art, creating installations and performances alone and in cooperation with oter artists.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Kenzo","Antonio Marras","Trend Les Copains","Kenzo Defile","Les Copains"]}

Four years later Adi and his brother Rudolph (Rudi, born 1902) founded the German sports shoe company Gebr\u00fcder Dassler OHG\u2014later known as adidas. The brothers' father was a cobbler in Herzogenaurauch, Germany, where they were born. \n By 1925 the Dasslers were making leather Fu\u00dfballschuhe (Adi was an avid soccer player) with nailed studs and track shoes with hand-forged spikes. Beginning with the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Adi's uniquely designed shoes began to gain a worldwide reputation. Jesse Owens was wearing a pair of Dassler's track shoes when he won gold for the USA at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. By the time of his death in 1959, Dassler held over 700 patents related to sports shoes and other athletic equipment. In 1978, he was inducted into the American Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame as one of the founders of the modern sporting goods industry. \n Adi and Rudi split up in 1948 when Rudi founded Puma (one of adidas' biggest competitors in Europe) and Adi renamed his firm by combining elements of his name. In the 1970s, adidas was the top athletic shoe brand sold in the US. Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier were both wearing adidas boxing shoes in their \"Fight of the Century\" in 1971. Adidas was named the official supplier for the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Although still a strong, well-known brand today, adidas' share of the world sports shoe market dropped over the years, and what began as a German family business is now a corporation (adidas-Salomon AG) combined with the French global concern Salomon. In 2004 adidas bought Valley Apparel Company, a U.S. company that held licenses for outfitting more than 140 U.S. college athletic teams. In August 2005 adidas announced that it was purchasing the American shoemaker Reebok. Currently, adidas ranks number two in worldwide sales, after first-place Nike and third-ranked Reebok. But the adidas world headquarters are still located in Adi Dassler's hometown of Herzogenaurauch. \n   In the 21st century Adidas have branched out into garments other than sports shoes. They started with sweatshirts and track pants. However they have now gone into partnership with Japanese fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto and have presented an Adidas line of womenswear.","the_look":"In the 70's Adidas trainers had been an anti-establishment fashion statement worn with jeans, but in the defiant label-aware 80's, branding took over and a sportswear company found itself at the heart of a fashion movement.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["2003 Adidas 3 Women (W)","2003 Adidas 3 Man (M)","2003 Adidas 3 Frozen (M)","2003 Adidas 3 Extreme Pour Elle (W)","2004 Adidas 3 Extreme Pour Lui (M)","2004 Adrenaline man (M)","2005 Adidas Originals (M)","2006 Adidas Originals pour Femme (W)","2006 Adidas Victory League (M)","2007 Adidas Moves 0:01 Moment of Truth (M)","2007 Adidas Pure Energy (M)","2008 Emotions in Motion - Floral Dream (W)","2008 Emotions in Motion - Fruity Rhythm (W)","2008 Emotions in Motion - Pure Lightness (W)","2008 Emotions in Motion - Tropical Passion (W)","2008 Energy Game (W)","2008 Fair Play (M)","2008 Natural Vitality (W)","2008 Passion Game (M)"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Adrienne Steckling","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/adrienne-steckling\/"],"biography":"Adrienne Steckling was born in 1934 in St. Joseph, Missouri, USA. Her shortened name was ADRI. \n She attended the School of Fine Arts at Washington University and in the summer of 1955 became guest editor of Mademoiselle's college issue. \n The following year, she studied at Parsons School of Design in New York, where she was strongly influenced by designer Claire McCardell, then a lecturer at the school. \n   From 1960 to 1967, Adri worked for the wholesale house of B.H. Wragge. She then designed for her own division \"Clothes Circuit\" at Anne Fogarty Inc. premises. In 1960 her name also appeared as Adri for Collector's Items. In the 1960's she worked most often in natural and synthetic mixtures of jersey, creating simple and fluid designs. Her short little dresses tended to be soft with V necked, wrapped fronts and high waists. In 1971 she was honoured by a fashion exhibition at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. From 1972 to 1974, she began producing her own line of clothes with the label ADRI, including accessories. Her clothing is functional, practical and easy to wear. She believes in building a wardrobe piece by piece with interchangeable separates. In 1975 she formed Adri Clotheslab Inc. She continued to make garments in synthetic jerseys, but later in the 1970's she turned to natural fibres such as unbleached linen. She continued through the 1980's to work with separates made in bold and natural fabrics, concentrating on black, white, beige and primary colours and with an easy-fitting cut. Since changing her corporate name to Adri Studio Ltd. in 1994, Adri has continued to design small collections. Hard at work in her New York studio, she has focused on designer collections exclusively. With her Egyptian partner, Nadia Abdella, Adri continues to fashion the fluid, timeless pieces for which she has always been known. \"The concept,\" she says, \"remains the same.\" This design concept was always, she noted, a very flexible, contemporary one and has continued into the 21st century quite successfully. She creates one exclusive designer collection a season that is both wholesale and retail. The Adri collections are available through exclusive stores and show in private clubs, such as The Ruins in San Francisco. This approach, both simple and consistent, and the adaptable charm and enduring quality of an Adri garment, have created a niche for the designer and, \"It's working,\" she says.","the_look":"Adri's early years with B.H. Wragge taught her the principles of tailoring and mix-and-match separates, long a staple of American sportswear. Designing for Anne Fogarty reinforced the feminine focus of Adri's design philosophy. Always, she returned to McCardell's tenet of form following function. Shapes were simple, skimming the body without extraneous detail or fussiness, often based on the practicality of athletic wear. While McCardell favored dresses, Adri emphasized trousers, later designing skirt-length trousers, or culottes, for variety.\nFrom the beginning Adri utilized soft, pliable fabrics such as knits, jerseys, crepe de Chine, challis, and leather. Her clothes were identified by their floaty qualities and she maintained that this softness made them easy to wear and provided relief from the frequent harshness of modern life. They were also ideal for tall, long-limbed, slender figures like her own. During the late 1960s Adri presented V-necked short dresses with high waists or wrapped fronts, in solid colored synthetic jerseys. Natural fibers, such as unbleached linen, came of use in the 1970s and knits continued to be staples for Adri skirts, trousers, and tunics in various lengths. By 1980 a typical Adri evening look consisted of silk trousers topped by a strapless chenille top and fluid lace jacket.\nInterchangeable neutral solids such as beige, black, and white were combined with bold primary colors so Adri's customers could collect the separates throughout the years and create their own ensembles, without having to purchase a new wardrobe each year. The simple timelessness of the designs, as well as their easy cut and fit, made this possible. Prices were in the moderate to better sportswear range.\nAdri wore her own apparel to accept her Coty award in 1982: a belted silver-grey (she called it \"platinum\") mohair sweater over midcalf culottes made of grey suede. Soon afterwards she branched out into menswear, creating unisex sweaters, cardigans, and vests. Evening looks continued to be based on day shapes, but fabricated of highly colored striped shiny rayon or mohair. Pullovers, jackets, and vests were frequently long, and Adri kept experimenting with new materials, such as eelskin, for her contrasting boldly colored belts, or handloomed Japanese fabrics with interesting textures. A touch of the opulent 1980s was evident in her use of tapestry jackets to be worn with velvet trousers, as well as damask and silk Jacquard.\nClothes like these can be easily adapted for homesewers, and Adri contracted with Vogue Patterns during the mid-1980s for a relationship that continued into the 1990s. The same McCardell-inspired sporty yet fluid lines were evident; shirtwaist dresses with topstitching detail, softly gathered jackets, shaped hemlines with gracefully flounced skirts, cummerbund accents to shorten the appearance of tall, slim figures, gently gathered waists, and easy wrap dresses were some of the offerings available to seamstresses wishing to recreate Adri's classic multifunctional designs.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Agnes Trouble","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/agnes-trouble\/"],"biography":"Born Agnes Trouble in 1941 in Versailles, France, she was brought up in the \"Alice-band\" bourgeois area of Versailles. \n She graduated from \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Versailles. A career soon followed when her personal style caught the eyes of ELLE magazine staffers at a Paris flea market. Her style of dress at the time, which included selections from France's Monoprix discount chain, was inspired less by fashion than thrift, but the magazine liked what it saw and hired her as a junior editor at the age of 17. With a mind towards designing rather than editing fashion, she left ELLE after less than two years, preferring apprenticeships even when they paid little and offered no time off. \n Agnes married Christian Bourgois in 1958 from whom she was later divorced. She married Jean Rene Claret de Fleurieu in 1980. She has five children from her two marriages. \n   She became a designer, buyer, and press attach\u00e9 for Doroth\u00e9e Bis in Paris. Since 1964 she freelance designed for Limitex, Pierre d\u2019Alby, V de V, and Eversbin. In 1966, she started her own company CMC, parent of the agnes b. label, and she opened her first boutique in Les Halles in 1975, where her affordable, relaxed, wearable clothes catered to a wide age group. Many of her early designs were adapted from French workers uniforms. Formerly a butcher shop, the black and white tiled store had a rustic, communal atmosphere, defined by an indoor swing for children and an impromptu aviary (in reality an on-site bird population that over time grew from two to 30). Agnes's friends were her first repeat customers. Agnes started designing menswear in 1981 after observing men appropriate clothes designed for women. She opened her first international store on Prince Street in New York's SoHo district in 1983. Her enthusiasm for the city stemmed from her love of the American crime film genre, dubbed film noir in France. This interest extended to the store's decor, which included vintage, oversized movie posters. The one-sheets would eventually draw the attention of filmmaker Harmony Korine, who would begin an artistic collaboration with agnes in 1999. Agnes b. launched \"Le B Perfume\" in 1987, a skincare and cosmetics line. Over time, her designs would grow to include maternity wear, shoes, and bags. Additionally, agnes b. has designed watches and eyewear for Seiko and a beauty line for L'Or\u00e9al. She has shops in London, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Los Angeles, with more to open in Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, and Singapore. Agnes b. founded a joint film concern with Korine called O'Salvation, under whose banner Korine began production on Mister Lonely in London in 2006. She also designated an entity for personal projects, christened Love Streams, with the blessing of Gena Rowlands, widow of John Cassavetes who directed the 1984 film of the same name. Her acts of film patronage include the supplying of completion funds to Gaspar No\u00e9 for Irr\u00e9versible (2002) and Claire Denis for Trouble Every Day (2001), as well as the underwriting of numerous film festivals. Now she is head of a cult fashion empire, mother of 5 and grandmother of another 5. Her life in Paris is a multi-dimensional mix of cultures, cuisine, art and cinema. She has shops in London, Amsterdam, Tokyo and New York although her atelier and headquarters are in the Republique area of Paris, a gritty working class area East of the city. Her home is in the Paris suburbs.","the_look":"She specializes in separates, notably a snap button cardigan. Much of the charm of her clothes lies in the fact that they have a worn-in look.

She spent her childhood in Southern Ireland and Tadcaster. It was at Tadcaster Grammar that she realized her design talent by making her own clothes and sometimes clothes for other children. In 1975, she met Jono Platt who remained her life and business partner for 23 years till 1998. They have a son born in the 1980's named Hamish Lloyd-Platt. \n They moved to the South of England and joined the Middlesex Polytechnic College, together and both took degrees in fashion and textiles. \n They set up a company which they called \"Ally Capellino\" in London in 1979. They thought that it was Italian for \"little hat\" and only later found out it meant \"little head\". \n   Allison worked for some time for the Courtauld Institute before starting her own concern. Ally Capellino originally sold hats, jewellery and accessories and started designing womenswear in 1980. She had started up in 1980, straight out from graduating from college, and offered her first collection in honour of the Moscow Olympics. The collections are presented in London, the first catwalk show was 1986. The first boutique was opened in 1988, in London. In 1987 the firm signed a licensing contract with the GCO Company in Japan, which aimed to achieve optimum positioning of the label in terms of retail, public relations, and advertising exposure. This was followed, in 1988, by the opening of the Ally Capellino store in Soho, London, which developed into an emporium for clothing, childrenswear, and lifestyle items. She has launched several lines in the 1980's and 1990's, Menswear in 1986, Sports line called \"Hearts of Oak\" in 1990, Minimum Capellino, her children's line in 1991 a unisex range of t-shirts, in 1993 and her Difussion line in 1996. In 1997 she opened a new store in Chelsea, London. In 1992 Ally Capellino signed an agreement with Coats Viyella, Britain's largest textile company, to promote and market their brand name and give them access to Coats Viyella's design and production facilities, among the most advanced in technological development in the world. In return Ally Capellino would bring a more fashion-oriented handwriting to the business through by acting as design consultants. This would, in turn, hopefully avert the criticism aimed at British clothing manufacturers for producing unadventurous products. In 1999, she set up the Capellino Design ltd. and the same year launched her Accessories line of mens and womens bags and belts, which has been very successful. Allison also lectures at the Royal College of Art, Ravensbourne College, the London College of Fashion and also at Central St. Martins College of Art and Design, in London, passing on her expertise to stars of the future. In the year 2000, the GirlGuiding UK body commission Ally Capellino to redesign the Girl Guide Uniforms, which turned out very well. Subsequently she also did new uniforms for the Brownies too. Her new studio\/showroom in Shoreditch was set up in 2002. The \"A for Ally Capellino\" line of tailored separates, denim clothing, knitwear and evening gowns, is sold at Debenhams and 30 other up-scale Stores in the U.K. She also has licensing arrangements for her garments in Japan.

He started drawing before he was walking and as he grew up, he was determined to become an artist. \n He started his career in Vienna in his teens, when he worked as a scenery painter in the theatre. \n He went to Paris in 1887 when he was 27 years old. He studied at the Academie Julian, although he was rather older than the other students. He spent some years in poverty, perfecting his art and shared a studio with Gauguin for some time. \n   In January 1985, he created a poster for a play by the famous actress Sarah Bernhardt called Gismonda. This was in the new style known as Art Nouveau. Overnight Mucha's name became a household word. Bernhardt signed him to a six year contract to design all her posters, sets and costumes. Mucha became very successful and in 1898 moved to a new studio. At the World's Fair in Paris in 1900, he designed the Bosnia-Hersegovina pavilion. His fame spread around the world, and his illustrations appeared in a variety of American magazines. Portraiture commissions also poured in. Alphonse Mucha is the most famous name associated with the Art Nouveau period. His flowing beautiful pictures had a great effect on the fashions of the period, when society ladies tried hard to imitate the style of the great beauties he portrayed. Mucha took a much more serious line in the 10's and 20's, drawing patriotic subjects and chronicling major events of the Slav nation. When the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia, the 79-year old Mucha was arrested and was ill treated at a Gestapo questioning session.

{"designer_name":"Andrea Pfister","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/andrea-pfister\/"],"biography":"Andrea Pfister was born in Pesaro, Italy in 1942. As a child, he moved to Switzerland where he was educated. Later, he returned to Italy to study art and languages. In 1961, he took a course in shoe design in Milan. Pfister has always been a couturier; he began his career at the top with Lanvin and Jean Patou at the age of 21. More recently, he created shoes for Italian dress designer Mariuccia Mandeli, whose Krizia collections are also often quirky, and for the Bruno Magli label. Pfister's business has evolved as well; in 2001 his company was acquired by Fin. Part Group, allowing the designer to retain creative control while reaching new markets. \n Pfister showed his first collection of shoes in 1965, and in 1967 opened his first shoe shop. \n Like all original designers, his ideas were plundered by others. Snakeskin, a favorite material, was used in multicolored patches over white kidskin on a court shoe called Mosaique. This style, from the early 1980s, is instantly recognizable because it has been copied more than any other shoes in the world. His most famous style must be the Birdcage shoe of 1979. This was a closed-back, opened-toed flat pump, with the main body constructed in an open latticework of thin leather straps. It spawned millions of copies. Its final form, far removed from the finely crafted snakeskin original, is as a molded plastic beach shoe. Pfister's style in his later collections became less ornate and subtler. Even as his personal style continues to evolve, museums across the globe have hosted retrospectives of his work, honoring his enduring influence and originality. \n   In 1994, he designed the stacked ball heel and starred upper and called it the \"Trapeze Brode\" recreating circus-like whimsy. Pfister diversified into handmade handbags, scarves, leatherwear, gloves, neckwear, and even picture frames, but remains committed to producing beautiful shoes. His attitude toward fashion is relaxed. Pfister styles complement current trends but can also stand alone. For him the client is \"the woman who mixes different pieces\u2014an Armani top, for instance, with a Donna Karan skirt, and a jacket by Ferr\u00e9. My shoes work best on the woman who's sure enough of herself to create her own combination.\" Andrea Pfister creates truly original footwear; though it may not be fashionable in a trendsetting sense. It may not always appeal to the mainstream idea of good taste, but the styles are extraordinary, often eccentric, and frequently enchanting, making him one of the most innovative designers of footwear.","the_look":"His shoes are colourful, stylish and amusing and have earned him a world-wide reputation. He has appliqued snakeskin penguins to the side of a boot, decorated the heel of a wedge mule with a 3-dimensional frolicking sea lion and wrapped a black suede boot with clasping hands.\nAndrea Pfister's shoes are essentially Italian in their craftsmanship and attention to detail. But there is an element of lightness and irreverence about his creations not usually associated with the traditional shoemaker. He improvises on themes\u2014starry skies, the sea, music, circuses, and Las Vegas\u2014designing shoes such as Martini Dry, with cocktail glass heels supporting slices of lemon. He uses applique motifs, so that when a sandal is called Jazz, it really does have a snakeskin saxophone on the upper.\nAnother reason for the originality of his work may be that unlike most footwear designers, Pfister is a colorist. Twice a year, he retreats for two months to prepare new collections. The starting point is always color, then he works on shape, proportion, and styling. He is involved with several tanneries, creating seasonal color charts and matching colors in diverse materials such as reptile and suede as a basis for his collections. Pfister's commitment to color also explains his copious use of ornamentation. Jewels, sequins, and glitter catch the light bouncing color off upper and heel as the shoes trip lightly along. The fullest ranges of materials are used to create the desired effects. He will use sumptuous handcrafted embroidery and silks and yet is equally at home with plastics and paste stones.","who_wears_it":["Elizabeth Taylor","Madonna"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

Her mother was a seamstress and Ann learned how to stitch at a very early age. She and her mother moved to New York, and Ann married Mr. Cohen. They had a son Arthur who died in 1958. Ann's mother operated a small dressmaking shop. \n When her mother died, Anne completed the dresses she was making and carried on the shop. At the same time to learn dressmaking in a more professional manner, she joined the S.T. Taylor Design School and graduated from their fashion design course. \n In the early 1950's Jacqueline Bouvier met her and ordered some of her dresses. When she became engaged to John Kennedy, she decided to get her wedding dress made from Ann Lowe, as well as 10 dresses for some of the other ladies at the wedding. \n   Ann Lowe worked hard, but was not very financially minded, and her tax records were lax. The I.R.S. decided that she owed them a lot of back tax and seized her shop in 1961 while she was in hospital having an eye operation. But when she came out she found some anonymous person had cleared all her debt. It was always supposed that this generous person was Jacqueline Kennedy. Ann recovered, and opened a boutique in Saks Fifth Avenue in 1961. The same year she was awarded the Couturier of the Year Plaque by New York Fashion society. She appeared in the National Social Directory and 1968 Who's Who of American Women. She also opened a new store on Madison Avenue in New York, which did very well. She made more than 2,000 dresses for the society ladies of New York, and was well known for using the \"trapunto\" technique in her dressmaking. Five of her gowns are now in the permanent collection of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Others are in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Black Fashion Museum in Harlem. Anne Cole Lowe retired in the 1970s and died in 1981 at the age of 83. There is a very interesting book \"Threads of time: the Fabric of History\" by Rosemary E. Reed Miller published by www.toastandstrawberries.com which covers the stories of 16 African-American women fashion designers including Anne Cole Lowe, which shows how ideas have changed about culture, fashion and clothing over the period of about a century.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Jacqueline Kennedy"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Antonio Lopez","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/antonio-lopez\/"],"biography":"Antonio Lopez was born in 1943, in Utado, Puerto Rico. He was the son of a couturier, and moved to New York at the age of eight. He studied at the High School of Industrial Art and the Fashion Institute of Technology. \n In the early 60's, he worked as a sketch artist on 7th Avenue, until in 1964, he met the designer Charles James, who was to be an enormous influence on him. Antonio worked with James, drawing all the designer's clothes, for a number of years. \n With the advent of fashion photography, Vogue magazine used lesser and lesser of the illustrator's art, with the exception only of Antonio, who was almost the only artist to be found in Vogue after 1963, because of the stylistic quality and great verve of his drawings. \n   In 1969, while on a working trip for Elle Magazine in Paris, he met fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who encouraged him to set up a studio in Paris. He did so and became the leader of a group of celebrities. He established himself as the foremost fashion illustrator on both sides of the Atlantic. His clever drawings of sculptured women are positive, vital and modern. Some of his very well-known illustrations are: 1967 Emanuelle Khanh ready-to-wear for French Elle 1981 Jerry Hall in Versace, for Italian Vogue 1983 Karl Lagerfeld guitar dress for Chloe 1983 Yves St. Laurent ad campaign Of all the latter day artists whom Vogue has chosen to employ, Antonio has been the most frequent visitor. He proved himself versatile and assertive. Some of his illustrations for Vogue include: In 1970 he illustrated a long willowy knife pleated flowered outfit by Bill Gibb. In 1972, he contributed a powerful set of drawings, showing Paloma Picasso wearing the new halter bras. In 1973, his sketches show a woman's face and make-up in the manner of the Fauve artists. It can be said of Antonio that his work helped create a return to the almost forgotten art of fashion illustration in magazines. He exerted a strong influence on many younger artists. He was the only artist commissioned by fashion magazines with any regularity during the lean years of the 60's and 70's. His was a style completely in tune with the rebellious clothes and free attitudes of the 60's. From the moment they were first published in Womens Wear Daily and the New York Times, Antonio's drawings were much in demand. He was sought out by designers, stores and magazines around the world. Chameleon-like, he changed his colours with the years, skillfully adapting to the current mode, his extraordinary vitality and his exquisite draughtsmanship inspiring scores of imitators. For over 20 years, Antonio remained the most consistently influential fashion illustrator and his career bridges the gap between the 60's and the renaissance of fashion illustration in the 80's. He died in 1987 at the young age of 44. In February 1997, a retrospective exhibition featuring over 150 of his superb illustrations, was held at the Royal College of Art in London, and was attended by crowds of people.

He took the name Scaasi which is Isaacs spelt backwards. He was the son of a furrier. His family moved to Australia when he was young. \n He returned to Canada and studied fashion design in Montreal before moving to Paris in the early 50's. He joined the Cotnoir-Capponi School of Design which was affiliated with the Chambre Syndicale School for Haute Couture. He undertook an apprenticeship with PAQUIN. He worked for two years with Charles JAMES in New York, before freelancing for Lilly DACHE (hat designer) among others. \n In 1955, Scaasi made the much-coveted Christmas cover of Vogue Magazine, with a dramatic red evening coat. \n   Scaasi began to rethink his objectives after juggling a career during the late 1950s and early 1960s that included menswear, children's wear, and costume jewelry, in addition to ladies' ready-to-wear and custom designs. He decided to focus strategically on couture dressmaking at a time when Paris couture was beginning to suffer. It was 1964 when Scaasi debuted his collection of eveningwear. He was able to take the freedom of the youth-obsessed 1960s and channel the energy into designs that featured keen attention to details and the workmanship of couture dressing. In 1958 he won the prestigious Coty Fashion Critics Award. Scaasi is the designer who changed the world's perception of Barbra Streisand with her almost see-through Oscar outfit in 1969. He is noted in the USA for his tailored suits and glamorous evening wear, cocktail dresses and suits, often trimmed with feathers, fur, sequins or fine embroidery. In 1989, he designed the blue velvet inaugural gown for Barbara Bush when her husband George Bush became US President. This dress is now part of the Smithsonian Institutions's garment collection. He has made many other gowns for Barbara Bush over the years. There were two major exhibitions of the work of Arnold Scaasi, one was at Kent State University from June 2001 to May 2002, entitled \"Scaasi, An American Icon\". The second was from October 2002 through till January 2003, when FIT New York held an exhibition of Scaasi gowns called \"Exuberant Fashion : A celebration of an American Couturier.\" In his new book \"Women I have dressed (and undressed)\" Arnold Scaasi accuses Oleg Cassini of copying French designs when dressing Mrs Jacqueline Kennedy from 1960 to 1963 when he was the official White House designer. Midyear 2001 was a financial success for Scaasi's Leisure Collection for QVC, which sold 4,500 pieces netting $250 million. His line showcased rose prints, leopard stripes, and tropical flora in at-home caftans and patio dresses.","the_look":"As a young apprentice to Charles James during the early 1950s, Arnold Scaasi was imprinted by James' concentration on \"building\" an evening dress as a sculpture. This early training led Scaasi to construct dresses in the round and to approach design as three-dimensional form. The influence of James has been a lifelong inspiration for Scaasi; another was the richness of the fabrics and furs used during the 1950s, when the prerequisite for women was to be perfectly dressed from head to toe.\nScaasi emphasized sequins, fringe, and feathers as trims, substituting new fabrics to create an ostentatious signature style that included minidresses, trouser suits, and the use of transparency. \nDuring the 1970s, styles changed to a more body-conscious, pared-down way of dressing. Scaasi, true to form, turned to dressing women who still loved to be noticed, such as artist Louise Nevelson. It made sense to Scaasi to continue creating what he was known for and what he loved to do. The basis of his work has been a combination of cut, color sensibility, and fabric selections recalling a past elegance yet which continue to speak to his clients' most current desires.","who_wears_it":["Barbra Streisand","Barbara Bush","Elizabeth Taylor","Ivana Trump","Blaine Trump","Joan Rivers","Barbara Walters"],"perfumes":["1989   Arnold Scaasi (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}

He draws inspiration from different cultures and the organic synergies between nature and man. \n Andres moved to New York City in 1997 to pursue a career in graphic design, after graduating from Skidmore College with a degree in Business and Fine Art. Through a twist of events, he was offered a job designing for Purple Label, Ralph Lauren's top line. \n This new insight into the world of high-end fashion, coupled with practical courses at the New York Fashion Institute of Technology, gave Andres courage to debut his first collection at a runway show of underground designers in DUMBO, Brooklyn. The experience opened up his eyes to seeing art in fashion, a perspective he tried to incorporate in his next position as designer at TSE. Here, he worked with Hussein Chalayan, Richard Chai (former head designer for Marc Jacobs), and stylist Lori Goldstein. \n   Andres left TSE in October 2002 to pursue the creation of his own designer label: DRES. DRES started as an accessory line of innovative rubber belts he patented for the distinctiveness in the product's elasticity, resilience, and durability. He formed a partnership with an industrial goods manufacturer and started working with materials new to apparel. Andres remains committed to academics and is a guest lecturer at the New York Fashion Institute of Technology. In Spring 2004, Andres introduced his first complete designer collection with Bryant Park during New York Fashion Week. Andres was the subject of a documentary on the UK's Channel 4, featured as an emerging fashion designer to watch out for. His collection was also covered by E Entertainment Channel, and publications including WWD. After a follow-up collection the consecutive year, the DRES line has since grown. DRES followed buyers requests and added a line of perforated leathergoods. This technique starts with the finest, most supple, thick Italian leather carefully perforated by craftsmen with mastery over half a century. The perforations enhance the leather by adding breathability, drape, texture, pattern, and reducing weight. Perforating transforms leather into a grid which provides a foundation for exact cutting and sewing. In the New York Studio the DRES collection is hand sewn and constructed using only the perforated holes. Each leather item is as beautiful on the inside as the outside. All seams and details are hand finished with perforated leather. DRES is available at Opening Ceremony and other fine stores.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Paris Hilton","Theodora Richards","and musicians Miss Kittin","and Peaches"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

His life partner is Alex Koo, Lanvin's director of marketing. \n In 1987, Elbaz moved to New York City, worked for two years for a manufacturer of mother-of-the-bride clothing. He went on to work for Geoffrey Beene for seven years. He says he was influenced by Beene's rejection of trends and masterful drape and fit. \"It was a very beautiful relationship... Our best dialogue was not in words,\" Elbaz has reminisced \n In 1997, Elbaz left Beene and, through retailer Dawn Mello, was hired by the firm of Guy Laroche. But, by the time of Elbaz's arrival, the Laroche enterprise had become overly conservative and lackluster. Even so, Elbaz was able to update the collection and somewhat enhance the image of the firm, whose activities at the time included the management of 15 boutiques and 70 license agreements worldwide. However, he departed within a year, 1998, and began designing ready-to-wear women's clothing for Yves Saint-Laurent, because Saint-Laurent himself wished to withdraw from his hands-on design of pret-a-porter. In the position, Elbaz's talent was recognized, and he would have become the head designer of the house when Saint-Larent retired. This was not to happen because the Gucci Group purchased YSL Rive Gauche, the ready-to-wear label, and, hence, Gucci design director Tom Ford dismissed Elbaz after 3 collections.

His vision for each piece manifests itself in his mind and is further influenced by whatever attracts his attention in that moment. The gamut runs from Hairsutism and Oxytocin to skydiving and police car chases, to name a few. \n He feeds this no-holds-barred, free-association creativity in many ways. From his frequent international trips and the latest art\/fashion installations, all keep Majtenyi on the pulse of what\u2019s to come in the world of fashion and trends. \n   In addition to creating couture-inspired and upscale sportswear collections for the sexy and bold woman, Majtenyi also designs for the film and television industry.

He was 12 when his father, a professor of literature, died. Much of his initiative seemed to spring from the family's matriarchs. His mother, Giulia, operated a local tailoring and pattern-making school that encouraged financial independence among young women. His great-grandmother, Marina Rinaldi, ran a dress shop in the 1850's, and it was after her that he named one of the first fashion labels for full-figured women, in 1980. \n After studying in Rome, Mr. Maramotti received a law degree from Parma University. While working on behalf of a Swiss client that manufactured raincoats, he decided to go into the garment business for himself. According to the family, the name Max Mara was a blend of Maramotti and that of a local bon vivant called Count Max, who apparently drank away his fortune in bars across Europe but at least looked good while doing it. \n From the outset, Mr. Maramotti was resourceful. To have his clothes seen by women, he persuaded local fabric shops to give him selling space and promote the new label in their windows. To give Max Mara's classic look a sense of chic, he hired designers like Karl Lagerfeld and Jean-Charles de Castelbajac to work for him anonymously. \n   Although Max Mara was based on the ideal of real clothes, Mr. Maramotti used the world's top fashion photographers, including Sarah Moon and Richard Avedon, to give the company's advertisements a visionary look. Responding to the youthful demands of the 1960's, he added a younger-looking line under the Sportmax label. Today the company has more than 20 different labels, about 1,700 shops around the world and sales of $1 billion. Mr. Maramotti retired in 1989 from the fashion side of the family's businesses, but continued his activities in banking and in collecting. Besides his wife and his son Luigi, Mr. Maramotti is survived by a brother, Guilio; a son, Ignazio; a daughter, Maria Ludovica; and nine grandchildren, all living in Reggio Emilia. He died in Albinea, Italy 12 January 2005. Maramotti's two sons and daughter, Luigi, Ignazio and Ludovica, followed him into the business; Luigi is chairman of the company. After his death, according to Maramotti's will, a large and important collection of contemporary art from Europe and America was made open to the public.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Max Mara","Sportmax Defil","Sportmax","Maxco","Weekend Max Mara","Marella","Marina Rinaldi"]}

He was born in Shanghai and raised in Hong Kong. Sung is th e brother of late Hong Kong actress Lydia Shum. \n Sung aspired to become a fine artist contrary to his parents' wishes that he pursue a traditional profession. In time, his father compromised and agreed to send him to Paris where he studied couture at the notable Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. \n After graduating with first-place honours, Sung moved to New York City to study at the Parsons School of Design. Upon completion, he began the task of honing his talent while working as an assistant designer for a Seventh Avenue dress manufacturer. \n   In 1972, Alfred Sung moved to Canada. His next step was designing for a sportswear manufacturer in Toronto's garment district. His exceptional fashion illustration skills allowed him to supplement his junior designer's wages for freelance projects. With the encouragement of friends and limited savings, he set out on his own. Sung opened a tiny shop called Moon in Toronto's trendy Yorkville neighbourhood. By 1989, Saul and Joseph Mimran together with Sung joined forces to create a business that soon changed the face of the Canadian fashion industry. In 1980, the three partners formed Monaco Group Inc., the corporate entity that would develop the Alfred Sung brand and the ready-to-wear collection directed to working women. Within months, the Alfred Sung brand appeared in major department and specialty stores across Canada. In 1981, the Alfred Sung label was launched in the United States through Saks Fifth Avenue. Within a year, the clothing appeared in stores such as Macy's, Nordstrom's, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. That same year, Sung opened his first freestanding store in Toronto's Hazelton Lanes. It was in 1983 that Canada's national news magazine, MacLean's, proclaimed Alfred Sung as Canada's \"King of Fashion\u201d.

{"designer_name":"Agathe Saint Girons","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/agathe-saint-girons\/"],"biography":"Born in Avignon to a mother from Arles and a father from Marseille, Agathe owes her ardour and fiery temperament to the south of France from where she originates. With a strong presence on the contemporary art scene both in France and internationally, her work has been shown and sold in contemporary jewellery and art galleries throughout the world, from Paris to New York, Sao Paulo, Yokohama, Beyrouth, Oslo and Barcelona. Agathe Saint-Girons opened her first studio in Montreuil on the outskirts of Paris in September 1992. Invited, on a regular basis, to help develop jewellery collections for international firms, Agathe also works with prestigious communications agencies carrying out special commissions for their clients. Having distinguished herself on interior design projects for both private and institutional clients and on dance and theatre installations, Agathe has excelled on needs-based projects by being especially attentive to her clients\u2019 wishes while remaining unwaveringly true to herself.","the_look":"Human beings have always been a source of inspiration for Agathe. Every single aspect of the human being is of interest to her, the physical, the mental, the social\u2026 Subject or object, observer or observed, fusion or conflict, every point of view opens onto a different scene, a different chapter. Every creation is the result of a special moment, an encounter. Like a story with no ending, it is very much like life itself. Ever since her very first collections, her work has been confirming and complementing the narcissistic and universal, alternatingly micro and macro treatment of a single script, that of relationships \u2013 love\/hate, words\/secrets, compassion\/provocation, lightness\/depth, commitments\/child\u2019s play, where time always figures as the key factor and sets the pace in her work. Agathe Saint-Girons\u2019 works are at times ephemeral, meant to be immediately destroyed like the crystal shell in which she imprisons certain pieces of jewellery or, at other times, anchored in eternity like the rings of her Kalligraphia collection on the subject of the written word. Spending time, wasting time, taking the time and never losing the thread and all in the spirit of love and humour.\nHer preferred materials are gold and silver which she accents with wood, coral and precious stones and then glass, of course, ever present in her sculptures, coloured, clear or opaque yet always deep and rich. The flamboyant and energetic back and forth between metal, mineral and organic matter testifies to her unrelenting curiosity for all of the elements and inhabitants of our planet. Agathe\u2019s logic of expression oscillates between positive and negative in fine balance between knowledge and that which resembles her.

After completing high school, he started sending his designs to companies in New York, and sold several. \n In 1939, when he was 17, he left the Midwest and went to New York, and started studying fashion design at Parsons School of Design. On graduation he worked as a sketcher for David Crystal, a Sportswear manufacturer, before being drafted for military service. \n   In 1945, after the war ended, he moved to Anna Miller and Cio., as a designer. Mrs Miller retired in 1959 and by that time Bill Blass was her chief designer. Her company was merged with that of her brother Maurice Rentner. His designs were very successful, and the company began to be more and more in his image. In 1970 he bought the company and it became Bill Blass Ltd. Blass designed for a host of famous women, including first ladies Nancy Reagon and Barbara Bush as well as Candice Bergen, Barbra Streisand and Barbara Walters. Bill Blass is often referred to as the \"Dean of American Designers\". For around 50 years he designed clothes to meet standards of country club and evoke Hollywood glamour simultaneously. He believed a designer should not be a dictator and the client must ultimately be in charge. He travelled all over the US making sure his clothes always work well. In the year 2000, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York.

He used tweeds and shirting\u2019s, often with a splash of colour, or a bright frill of lace or fur trim.

In 1949 Cashin returned to New York. In 1953 she opened her own business. In 1961 Bonnie was awarded the American Designers Coty Award. She is one of the most original designers in America and has won countless awards and citations. The Brooklyn Museum has been collecting Bonnie Cashin originals for many years.

During the 50's and 60's - her most creative years - she produced, among other numerous garments, Chinese style jackets over dresses, canvas and poplin raincoats, fringed suede dresses, wool tabards, kimono coats piped with leather and long dinner jackets made of upholstery fabric. Bonnie Cashin is most often associated with the Poncho as a fashion garment. She was also famed for her long fringed skirts made from plaid mohair, and with her signature funnel-necked pullover sweater featuring a neck doubling as a hood.

{"designer_name":"Bella Freud","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/bella-freud\/"],"biography":"the designer \n Bella Freud was born in London on 17 April 1961. She is the daughter of artist Lucian Freud and great granddaughter of the inventor of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud. Her only full sibling is her sister, writer Esther Freud, who wrote the memoir of their hippy childhood in Morocco, Hideous Kinky. \n Freud's involvement with British fashion began in 1977 when, at the age of 16, she was offered a job by Vivienne Westwood at her World's End shop, then called Seditionaries. Freud decided to study fashion in Rome and left Westwood's shop for Italy where for the next three years she studied fashion at the Accademia di Costume e di Moda, tailoring at the Istituto Mariotti, and designed shoes for private clients in her spare time. Freud completed her fashion training under Vivienne Westwood (who is held in high regard for her tailoring technique) where she worked as an assistant in the Westwood design studio for four years. \n   It was in 1989 that Freud decided the time was right to launch her own label\u2014a move many thought was foolhardy\u2014with Britain in the midst of recession. Freud presented her first collection for fall\/winter 1991 in March 1990, which consisted of tailored knitwear and accessories. Her \"violin case\" bags, typical of her slightly quirky style, were photographed by Vogue magazine in New York. The following season the designer added tailored pieces to the collection which were manufactured for her in Italy. Knitwear continued to play an important role in Freud's collections and became a Freudian hallmark, along with the bags and shoes which made up the total Freud look. Success and recognition came in October 1991, when she launched a collection at the London Designer Show exhibition for the first time, the very same month she was named Young Innovative Fashion Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards ceremony. She also undertook consultancy work for the British fashion compny Jaeger during the 1990s. In her most recent fashion quest she has been responsible for the relaunch and revamp of fashion house Biba. For spring\/summer 1993 Freud introduced a range of denim pieces which included a jeans-style dress, jacket, and trousers, and these soon became an established part of each collection, produced in different designs and colored denims. Freud also works closely with milliner Philip Treacy who has designed the hats for her collections. Fashion journalist Lisa Armstrong, writing for the February 1994 issue of London Vogue, succinctly described Freud's style as being \"\u2026a bit like Sharon Stone wearing a St. Trinian's uniform designed by a Paris couturier.\" In an appearance on the BBC current affairs program Newsnight on August 2 2006, Bella Freud voiced an impassioned denunciation of Israel\u2019s \u201cdisproportionately violent aggression\u201d in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict, for which she has apparently received some criticism. Bella Freud writes a weekly column in the Sunday Telegraph free magazine Stella, called \u201cBella on Beauty\u201d. She recently partook in a fashion shoot with the closest of Vivienne Westwood\u2019s friends and clientele, in which Bella was dressed in a gold boiler suit complete with pipe and hat.","the_look":"Bella Freud is known for her whimsical designs which include somewhat kitschy elements, colorful knitwear, and modern tailoring. Essentially, her designs are recognizably British, but as one of Freud's friends described, \"Chanel gone kinky.\" Bella, the great-granddaughter of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and the daughter of painter Lucien Freud (who designed her logo), is now part of the London fashion establishment.\nFreud's designs are an interesting combination of tailored pieces which have a somewhat prim air about them, teamed with short skirts and ultra-high-heeled shoes\u2014blending an air of innocence with provocative appeal. The designer cites the Edwardian period as being a major source of inspiration, with its formal silhouette and what Freud describes as its \"suppressed-looking\" style. Other important influences include designers Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent and, not surprisingly, her mentor Vivienne Westwood. Westwood's influence is evident in Freud's decidedly English-styled tailoring, although it is somewhat less structured, which Freud admits she owes to the Italian influence during her fashion training: \"Their tailoring is much more extravagant\u2014and sexy\u2014whereas English tailoring is much plainer.\" Eveningwear by Freud is more glamorous and has included floor-length satin sheaths and crepe gowns with maribou cuffs in a distinctive 1940s-style air. Freud's little day dresses, which come in both stretch fabrics and as more tailored shapes, also possess the same balance of formality and quietly provocative sex appeal.\nIn addition to using traditional British styles, Freud has also relied on the elements and style of dress that she was accustomed to while growing up in Morocco. As a child, she was \"mad about uniforms\" and even wanted her mother to dress in a kaftan with a veil \"like all the other mothers.\" She became aware of the importance of clothes and wanted her own clothes \"to be like armor,\" to make her feel like she could \"forget about myself.\" Yet as an adult, in dealing with fashion, Frued contends that \"when you look fantastic then you can stop worrying.\" Fans of Freud can learn more about her childhood in the video Hideous Kinky, a film based on her sister Esther Freud's fictionalized account of their early life in Marrakesh.","who_wears_it":["Madonna","Kate Moss","Courtney Love","Saffron Burrows","Marianne Faithful","Jerry Hall","Anita Pallenberg","Lucy Ferry","Chloe Sevigny","Jasmine Guinness","and Jane Birkin"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bella_freud","brands":["Bella Freud","Biba","Jaeger"]}

In the \"belle \u00e9poque\" period Drecoll specialized in promenade gowns and evening dresses with boned bodices, tight waists and full skirts, which produced the S-shaped figure of the period. \n   Photographs in Les Modes show that Drecoll ensembles were fussier and trimmed with more confection than comparable outfits from other couture houses. In the 1920's, the house was known for chic, short, low-waisted gowns teamed with the cloche hat, a tight fitting hat shaped like a bell and pulled low over the forehead. These flapper outfits were illustrated in luxury fashion magazines such as Art Gout and Beaute. In 1929, the Besancon daughter Maggy, took over Drecoll with her husband Pierre. In the same year, Drecoll merged with the house of Beer. In 1931 a further merger took place with the house of Agnes, which had been established since 1906.

{"designer_name":"Betsey Johnson","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/betsey-johnson\/"],"biography":"Betsey Johnson was born in Connecticut, USA in 1942. Betsey Johnson is a fashion designer best known for her feminine and whimsical designs. She also is known for doing a cartwheel at the end of her fashion shows. She took many dance classes as a child and adolescent which inspired her love of costumes. After high school, Johnson spent a year at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, before graduating from Syracuse University in 1964, where she was a member of the Alpha Xi Delta sorority. \n During 1964, she was guest editor on the summer college issue of Mademoiselle and was hired by the magazine for one year after graduation. During that period she made and sold clothing designs in her spare time and later became a freelance designer, retailing through a New York boutique called Paraphernalia. \n In 1967 she married Velvet Underground's John Cale. They divorced later in the year. She had a daughter, Lulu, in 1975 who now works with her. \n   She is a survivor of breast cancer and is a breast cancer awareness advocate. She has also had numerous facial plastic surgeries. She resides in New York but spends time in a house she owns in Mexico, which she dubbed \"Villa Betsey\". Betsey also converted an old, small hotel in Mexico into a house which she rents out to interested people; this is called \"Betseyville\", and can accommodate 8\u201310 people. Johnson's fashion career started when she entered and won the Mademoiselle Guest Editor Contest. Within a year she was the in-house designer for the Manhattan boutique Paraphernalia. Johnson became part of both the youthquake fashion movement and Andy Warhol's underground scene, along with The Velvet Underground, Edie Sedgwick and Lou Reed. In the 60's, Johnson gained a reputation as a radical young designer, producing chalk-striped 'gangster' trouser suits, a clear vinyl dress sold with paste-your-own star motifs, a 'noise' dress made of jersey with loose grommets attached to the hem, silvery motorcycle suits, clinging T-shirt dresses and a wrapped cowhide mini dress which was worn with thigh high leather boots. In 1969, she opened a New York boutique called \"Betsey, Bunkey and Nini' In the 70's, Johnson turned to Disco wear and showed extravagant body-conscious clothes, many made up of stretch jersey. Edie Sedgwick was her house model and Johnson designed the clothing Sedgwick wore on her last film, Ciao! Manhattan. In the 1970s, Johnson took control of the fashion label \"Alley Cat\" which was popular with the rock 'n roll musicians of the day. In 1978, Johnson started her own fashion line and then opened up her first retail store in Soho. Today, there are over forty-five of her stores worldwide. In 1991, she launched a new division called \"Luxe,\" which drew from her background in dance. The more expensive line was designed to complement the skirts and leggings that had been her trademark. In 1992 she launched her sweetly sexy swimwear collection of push-up bras, bikinis with petticoats, and skirts in black lace, gingham, madras, and velvet, all priced affordably from $35 to $75. She also unleashed a line of clunky funky women's shoes. And her 1993 line of menswear looked tailor-made for all modernday Robin Hoods: velvet capes and tunics, hooded monk robes, forest and mead-hued caftans, and paisley leggings. That year also brought her own fragrance, a light floral scent of lilies and mimosas. Forever evolving, Johnson introduced a new \"Ultra\" collection featuring better fabrics and more elaborate styling and priced up to $500 in 1996. In 1999 the Council of Fashion Designers of America, presented Betsey with their Timeless Talent Award, as a recognition of her ability to change with the times and her continued success in the fashion world for over 3 decades. A dress with a 10-inch extended collar, worn by Julie Christie, the film star, made her name when it sold in the thousands. Betsey says : \"fashion is all about having fun and mine are clothes to have fun in\". Going into the 21st century, she is still making fun clothes. For her Spring 2001 collection, Betsey recruited 29 Playboy bunnies to model her line of bikinis and bustiers. It was a real smash. As of 2001, almost 40 Betsey Johnson stores were open worldwide, with further expansion planned. Her label is available in several upper-end department stores and specialty stores, together with Johnson's designer-price brand, Ultra. Throughout the 1990s, Betsey Johnson, Inc. continued to broaden its offerings, developing a line of accessories, jewelry, footwear, children's clothing, bath and beauty products, and fragrance. Betsey has been married three times and has a daughter Lulu. She gives no attention to age and says she feels as if she is 22. On her 60th birthday in 2002, she did a back-flip at the party by her pool. In the year 2000\/2002, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along the pavement of 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Betsey Johnson was one of those honoured with a plaque this year. Then in 2003, she expanded her line for 2004 to include handbags, accessories, hats, and scarves.","the_look":"For the youthquake generation, the names Betsey Johnson and Paraphernalia symbolized the hip, young fashions of mid-1960s America just as Mary Quant and Biba did for the equivalent age group in Great Britain. In the early 1970s, a second wave of young women with a taste for affordable style discovered the flippant body-conscious clothes Johnson designed for the ready-to-wear firm Alley Cat. Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, Johnson's clothes have been characterized by her sense of humor and an innocent, tongue-in-cheek sexiness. Wearing a Betsey Johnson dress is like putting on a good mood.\nJohnson's approach to clothing is very much influenced by her early days as a dancer. \"I am basically about a ballerina torso and a full skirt,\" she told a reporter for the Soho News in 1982, \"a dancing school dress-up craziness.\" Johnson's emphasis on tight, stretch bodices also grew out of her dancing school background. Not surprisingly, the shift in the 1970s to a subdued, tailored look was incompatible with Johnson's style as a designer. She continued to have her own label with a variety of manufacturers, but it was not until the end of that decade that Johnson's real joie de vivre emerged again, this time for her own company.\nJohnson's company and her girlish, bohemian style have continued to endure, despite the economic downturns of the late 1980s and the androgynous \"grunge\" trends of the early 1990s. In the final years of the century, Johnson's flirty and whimsical designs were again at the forefront of fashion trends. \nThe youthful spirit of the company is kept alive through Johnson's own playful personality and the design talents of a young staff, including her daughter, Lulu Johnson. Betsey Johnson is the first to admit that her designs have changed little conceptually over her long career, but she is able to manipulate this basic style to suit a contemporary mood. Johnson's loyalty to her own vision has been crucial to her success and appeal.","who_wears_it":["Rockers Now and Rockers Then: Madonna","Courtney Love","Cher","Lil\u2019 Kim","Aerosmith\u2019s Steven Tyler","Lenny Kravitz","Prince","Sarah McLachlan","Minnie Driver","Paris Hilton","Salma Hayek","Heather Graham","Helena Bonham Carter","Julie Christie","Brigitte Bardot","model Twiggy","Jackie Kennedy"],"perfumes":["2006 Betsey Johnson (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Betsey Johnson"]}

The oversized printed shirts and hand-knit sweaters are always popular and usually the first garments to sell out. Her previous print and knit themes were inspired by Sonia Delauney, oversized paisleys or abstract painterly shapes and textures reminiscent of Matisse or Braque.\nJackson never uses androgyny to shock or alienate her established customer or to make a fashion statement. Instead, her themes evolve each season, incorporating the newest shapes, lengths, and fabrics. She tends to favor expensive, supple fabrics like linen, suede, or viscose mixes, crepes, chenilles, and soft jerseys.\nShe emphasized soft colors of beige and green, with brighter colors as highlights. The fluidity of the garments was complemented by harder leather accessories.

This influence has affected his mot spectacular work. \n Arriving in London at the age of 19 from northern Scotland, Bill Gibb was already obsessed with the dream of a career in fashion. He trained at St. Martin's School of Art, then at the Royal College under the aegis of Professor Janey Ironside. An unprecedented flow of new talent was to emerge from the college in the early 1960s. For the next three years Gibb worked for Baccarat, the prestigious London fashion house, before setting up his own company in 1972 with a complete team, including designers, cutter, and business manager. \n In 1974 he produced a knitwear collection working with MISSONI and knitting specialist Kaffe Fassett, which became highly successful. He also opened a retail business in 1975. \n   Gibb was highly acclaimed in the 70's but inspite of his considerable design talents and his skill in handling lavish and exotic fabrics, Gibb was forced for financial reasons to close his firm in the 1980's.

Boldly inventive to the point of abandon at times, he mixed and matched materials and colors. His mood was romantic and far out: the effects often larger than life and always unmistakably his own. \"I feel,\" he had said, \"rather than dictate. I create a mood.\" Gibb wanted to create coordinates that gave women choice and pleasure to assemble in the \"Gibb style,\" and with homage to the ethnic feeling of the day, he mixed florals with geometrics, tartans with checks, and produced sunray pleated, beaded and fringed separates, all of which became very popular.\nGibb's output during the 1970s was of such a consistently high standard, it verged on couture. He was probably best known for his evening gowns, fabulous concoctions in floaty and exotic fabrics embellished with appliqu\u00e9s or heavily embroidered nets and lace, silks, brocades, and chiffon panels.","who_wears_it":["Twiggy","Bianca Jagger and Elizabeth Taylor"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Barbara Hulanicki","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/barbara-hulanicki\/"],"biography":"Barbara Hulanicki is a Warsaw- born fashion designer, known for being the founder of the iconic clothes store Biba. \n Born in Warsaw, to Polish parents, after studying at Brighton Art College, now the University of Brighton, Hulanicki won a London Evening Standard competition for beachwear in 1955. She began her career in fashion as a freelance fashion illustrator, covering all the important fashion collections for the major publications of the day, including Women's Wear Daily, British Vogue, the Times, the Observer and the Sunday Times. In 1964 she founded, with her late husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon, the boutique BIBA, beginning as a small mail-order business featured in the fashion columns of newspapers such as the DAILY MIRROR. \n After a few false starts and refusing to give up, their last-ditched attempt -- a pink gingham dress with a round hole in the back and a matching head scarf -- strikes a chord with the public and sells thousands of units, allowing them to open a store which becomes an icon of hip 60's and 70's London. \n   The shop soon became famous for its stylishly decadent atmosphere and lavish decor inspired by Art Nouveau and Art Deco. It became a hangout for artists film stars and rock musicians. In the shop affordable mini-skirts, floppy felt hats, feather boas, velvet trouser suits and unisex T-shirts dyed in rich, muted colors were eagerly snapped up by a young clientele. Anna Wintour got her start in fashion as a Biba employee. The first Biba store was a small Chemist's shop in Abingdon Road, but by the time Biba's doors closed in 1976 it had evolved into an elaborate 5-story Art Deco department store with a restaurant and a roof garden overlooking High Street Kensington. The avant-garde BIBA cosmetics brand was being sold in 33 countries across the globe. After the closure of Biba, Hulanicki continued to work in the fashion industry, designing for such fashion designers as Fiorucci and Cacharel and for twelve years, from 1980 to 1992, designed a successful line of children's wear, Minirock, licensed to the Japanese market. In 1980, she returned to the UK from living in glamorous Brazil to open a series of clothing boutiques and start a make-up line, all under her own name. From 1980 to 1987, she dabbled in fashion photography for the London Evening Standard and returned briefly to fashion illustration to draw Sarah Ferguson's wedding dress for the London newspapers. In 1983 she wrote her memoirs in the book FROM A TO BIBA, which was published by Hutchinson's. In 1987 she arrived in Miami Beach where she reinvented herself yet again as a designer of interiors and exteriors, single-handedly reconceiving Miami Beach's then re-emerging Art Deco District. Her projects began with Woody's on the Beach, which she designed in 1987 for Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones. She created a series of restaurants, night clubs and super-clubs, including Who's in the Grove, Sempers, Match Club and Bolero Restaurant. From 1992 to 1997 she worked for Gloria and Emilio Estefan designing the interiors for their personal recording studios, the interiors of the Cardozo Hotel on Ocean Drive, their private home on Star Island, costumes for the music video \"Mi Buen Amor\", as well as consulting on BONGO, the Estefan's restaurant project in Disney World, Orlando, with the Architectonica Group. From 1990 to the present, Hulanicki has perhaps had the most impact on Miami Beach through her work for Chris Blackwell and his Island Outpost Group. She has twice reconceived the MARLIN Hotel, on Collins Avenue, as well as the CAVALIER Hotel, Ocean Drive, the LESLIE Hotel, Ocean drive, The NETHERLANDS building, Ocean Drive, and now the KENT on Collins Avenue. Other Caribbean properties she has designed for Blackwell include the COMPASS POINT Hotel and beach resort in Nassau, Bahamas - which is prominently featured in all the Bahamian Tourist Board television commercials - the PINK SANDS resort on Harbor Island, Bahamas. In 1993 Hulanicki won an award from the American Institute of Architects for her work on the NETHERLANDS, as well as an award from an association of Florida Architects. From 2001 to 2002 she worked on the Island life Ministore, located in the heart of Miami Beach on Ocean Drive. This unique shop was renovated completely by Hulanicki at owner Chris Blackwell's request. Coined as \"tropical lux,\" this lifestyle store contained a large collection of gift items, music and film, jewelry and accessories from around the world. It also boasted men's, women's and children's apparel custom colored and designed by Hulanicki herself. The crowning achievement of Hulanicki's impact can be witnessed in the opening of the Hollywood hit movie \"The Birdcage\". A sweeping helicopter shot flows over the waves to zero in on the primary location for the film, the Cleveland Hotel on Ocean Drive which is flanked by no less than four Hulanicki-designed buildings - the Leslie, the Cardozo, the Cavalier and the Netherlands. British retailer Topshop opened a New York store in April 2009 and, late the same month, launched a highly anticipated collection featuring Hulanicki's designs available both instores and online. Hulanicki was approached by Topshop buyers at an exhibition of her illustrations in a London gallery which resulted in a final collection featuring billowing chiffon dresses and blouses reminiscent of the original Biba style. Alongside these were several highly covetable jersey pieces printed with Barbara's original illustrations, bikinis and a cropped suede jacket. The collection has been extremely successful for Topshop with rails stripped within minutes. An autumn\/winter collection is currently in production expected to be released by the end of the year. Released the same month was a handbag she designed for the Italian label Coccinelle, also featuring her art nouveau style, which was favourably reviewed by the website Handbag. Additionally, throughout her career, Hulanicki has designed costumes for several stage and film productions, including clothing for Cathy McGowan on the influential live TV rock show \"READY STEADY GO\" (1964), outfits for Julie Christie in \"DARLING\" (1965), costumes for local productions in Miami Beach, costumes for old friend and Biba model Twiggy for \"CAPTAIN BEAKY\" in London's West End and her Royal Command Performance in 1976.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Mick Jagger","Rolling Stones","David Bowie","Marianne Faithfull","Cathy McGowan"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Biba"]}

Under the label of her husband Herbert Levine she was the best-known American women's shoe designer from the 1950s to the early 1970s, and is still referred to as \"The first Lady of American Shoes Design\". \n She was born as Elizabeth Katz in Patchogue, New York, the third of five children of Anna and Israel Katz, Lithuanian Jewish emigrants who operated a dairy farm. In the 1930s, she moved to Manhattan and found work as a shoe model, then worked her way up from a stylist to head designer for I. Miller. She served as a Red Cross volunteer during World War II. \n She met Herbert Levine when she applied for a job designing shoes for another shoe manufacturer in 1944 and married him three months later. He was head of the firm, and this gave her designs the chance to come to center stage. They founded a new company under the name Herbert Levine in 1948. Beth Levine described their vision for the company by saying, \"We wanted to create a shoemaking niche. We were making very pretty shoes that nobody needed, but everybody wanted\". \n   Although the company was named after publicity-savvy former-journalist Herbert, Beth Levine's name was still featured as the primary shoe designer for their products. She was given the Coty Award in 1967 for design innovation. The Levines' greatest influence is considered to be the re-introduction of boots to women's fashion in the 1960s and the popularization of the shoe style known as mules.

Lintner may use her evenings to work with her design team, but nothing beats the buzz of wearing them into the office the next day. Plus, her colleagues and clients are also her fashion muses and customers, often ordering her dresses on the spot. Similarly, Lintner couldn't work solely in fashion. Financially, it wouldn't be viable, with her day job supporting her label, and she still loves the high of doing an investment deal. But just when she's starting to sound like superwoman, Lintner does admit it can all get a little overwhelming from time-to-time. Like most fashion labels, cash flow is an on-going concern, especially in a credit crunch. But it's the relentless pace of life and the growing demands on her time \u2013 raising a young family, dealing with a volatile market \u2013 that sometimes leads to a wobble and a good cry. But then she's right back in there again - wiping away the tears, checking the time, swatting away the negativity and on to the next thing. A business meeting? A bedtime story? Her next collection? It's anyone's guess.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Sarah Brown"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Bernard Chandran","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/bernard-chandran\/"],"biography":"Dato' Bernard Chandran  is a Malaysian fashion designer. His talents have earned him many faithful clients among Malaysia's elite most notably the Royal families of Malaysia and Brunei as well as two former Miss Universe. Due to this, Chandran used to be known as Malaysia's \"Prince Of Fashion\", but is now being hailed as Malaysia's \"King Of Fashion\". \n Bernard Chandran is also a Malaysian television personality. He's known as the chief designer of the reality television show Project Runway Malaysia, since its debut on 8TV on 3 August 2007. \n He is also a brand ambassador for the Tiffani By Izen service apartments (to be completed in 2009), developed by Ireka Land Sdn Bhd. \n   Chandran was a guest judge on Britain's Next Top Model, Cycle 6, Episode 12. The top three models were given the chance to model for Chandran's fashion show during the London Fashion Week. Bernard Chandran was born to Mr. P Ramachandran and Mrs Chow Yook Lin.  Bernard Chandran is of both Indian and Chinese parentage (commonly referred to as Chindian in Malaysia). He grew up in an average Malaysian family. His father wanted him to become an accountant and he almost followed this advice, before briefly considering being a tobacconist, \"It's a good career!\". At aged 16, he had already decided he wanted to be a fashion designer and it was just a case of convincing his father. He initially studied fashion in a local fashion college known as International Fashion Training Centre (IFTC) in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. During his time at the college, he was known for his shyness backstage around the undressed models during his initial fashion shows at the local college. Given three months after graduation to prove himself, he arranged his debut solo show, taking the first steps on the road to becoming Malaysia's top designer. Bernard's father was won over and helped fund his son's further studies, with Bernard soon winning a place at the prestigious Paris Fashion School in Paris, France. In 1991, he decided to join the 'Open European Contest for Look of the Year 2000'. Chandran won and broke the record of being the first non-European to win the coveted title. For his pains, Chandran received a camera, 19 000 francs, and more important publicity and contacts which opened doors. Lolita Lempicka offered him a job on the spot, which was flattering but he felt it was still too early. Chandran is only too aware how important this was in starting his career. After honing his skills overseas in Paris, he returned to Malaysia to set-up his maiden shop in KL Plaza in 1993. The first 'Bernard Chandran' couture house was a small rented shop with a handful of staff in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. From there, he built up his client base amongst the who's who of Kuala Lumpur, ranging from the rich to royalty. He has now expanded his shop in KL Plaza to take up 4 shop lots and is nearly 300 square meters in area. He was voted Designer of the Year by the Malaysian International Fashion Awards in 2003. Chandran has also started introducing Europe to his couture with a boutique at swanky Knightsbridge, London. His creations are drawn from Chinese, Malay, Indian and other eastern cultures. He regularly does shows around the world, although he does tailor his overseas ranges to be more daring than his range for Malaysia. Bernard believes in the importance of creativity, confidence and vision. Chandran himself has appeared on the covers of numerous Malaysian magazines, such as Malaysia Tatler, Shape Malaysia, Female, Men's Health and Parenthood. His wife, Datin Mary Lourdes Chandran has shared spotlight with him on few covers too.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Kanye West","Lady Gaga","Jay Leno","Rihanna","Tori Amos"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Bernard Chandran"]}

{"designer_name":"Cristobal Balenciaga","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/cristobal-balenciaga\/"],"biography":"Cristobal Balenciaga Eisaguirre was born in 1895 in Guetaria, Spain. He is the creator of some of the most powerful styles of the twentieth century, who has frequently been described as a prophet. How he pictured the female form and how he used that shape as a jumping- off point resulted in some of the most dramatic shifts in silhouette to follow Christian Dior\u2019s postwar New Look. \n After apprenticing with tailors in San Sabastian and Madrid, he opened his own couture salon in San Sabastian in 1915, frequently travelling to Paris to purchase couture dresses to study and to sell. Eventually he opened two more houses in Spain, naming them after his mother, Eisa. This was run by his sister from 1948 to 1968 when it closed. In 1935 he opened his Barcelona salon. \n He left Spain when the civil war broke out and established himself in Paris  where he opened an haute couture house in August 1937. From the start, a style was created which lived up to its expectations for thirty glorious years. \n   1938 The Duchess of Westminster ordered a pink jersey dress, and the American buyers ordered many of his gowns. Within a year, his name was heard everywhere. In 1947 Balenciaga made women\u2019s suits in a new \u201cBarrel\u201d style. He developed a narrow, straight \u201cI-shaped\u201d line, which influenced other designers. Balenciaga hated the fashion press and publicity, and from 1957 denied them entry to his collections. He held his shows a full month after all the other couturiers. He hated the idea of working to please a voracious press that demanded new ideas with every collection. He did not work that way. He refined his ideas with every collection, increasing the level of excellence. He trained Givenchy, Courreges, Ungaro and others and they even now, regard him as their mentor. In 1957 he invented the Trapeze line for dresses and one year lager her introduced the Empire line and designed the \u201cPillbox\u201d hat. In the 60's he was not as popular as he once was and he was not interested in going into pret-a-porter as many designers did. So in 1968 he retired which was a great surprise to everyone. He made only one more creation, the wedding dress of the Duqesa de Cadiz in 1972. Balenciaga\u2019s clientele was comprised of some of the most distinguished people of his day, from social arbiters Pauline de Rothschild, Bunny Mellon, Mrs. Arturo Lopez-Willshaw, and the Duchess of Windsor, to people in the arts like Clare Booth Luce, Rosamund Bernier, Diana Vreeland, Anita Loos, Inge Morath, and even Yul Brynner. In 1974, after working in Paris for 30 years, he decided to retire and closed his fashion houses in Paris, Barcelona and Madrid, one after the other. Balenciage died on March 24 1972 in Valencia,Spain.","the_look":"Balenciaga was revered by his fellow designers.

His daywear dresses, suits, and even hats were simple, practical and elegant. His evening designs allowed room for frivolity, using elaborate fabrics, heavy beading, feathers, and wide, puffy skirts. Many of his designs were inspired by Spanish regional dress and influenced by paintings of the old Spanish masters.\nThe sleeve\nHe was always fanatically precise about sleeves. He himself cut them mathematically and would never allow a less than perfect sleeve to leave his salon on anybody, even visitors. The perfect sleeve should be a living sculpture, beautiful to behold, a discreet play of subtle folds ensuring total comfort. Many people who came to his salon, had their coats snatched away by the Master for improvements to the sleeves. These included the wife of the Spanish Ambassador, Hubert de Givenchy and Bettina Ballard. \nThe colours\nBlack was very evident, the black of Spain, so deep in tone that all other blacks looked grey beside it. He used all the browns, from chocolate to nutmeg, palest aquamarine, ice or hot pink, goldenrod, peacock blue, melon orange and teal green.

She studied Textile design in Manchester, where in 1959 she met the fashion designer Ossie Clark, to whom she was married in 1969. Theirs was an almost perfect marriage of style, and their work together defined the era. \n The collaboration began with a 1966 collection for the \"Quorum\" boutique in London, which they shared with the designer Alice Pollock. \n   It was the Clarks who began the modern catwalk show: the previous procession of modeled clothes was put to music, the London glitterati was invited, and the shows became events. Birtwell worked at home designing textiles for Clark, who would use his skill in cutting and understanding of form, together with her knowledge of fabrics and textures to produce haute couture for the emerging 60\u2019s culture. This included work for the Rolling Stones and Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd, as well as Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull, Bianca Jagger, Verushka, Paloma Picasso, Talitha Getty and numerous other international celebrities. They had two children together, Albert (born 1969) and George (born 1972), but their private relationship could not match their professional, and they divorced in 1974 due to Clark's hedonistic lifestyle and his homosexual relationships. After the break-up of her marriage Birtwell continued in fashion, designing for the Radley label for a time, until in 1984 she set up a shop on Westbourne Park Road in Bayswater selling fabrics for the home. Again she built up a reputation for innovative and witty design. Her first success came with her own take on a 16th century animal print she called \u2018Animal Solo\u2019, followed later by the first, and much copied, white on white Voile and Muslin fabrics. These fabrics are now to be seen in many homes, hotels and public spaces, including Claridges and The Lanesbourough Hotels in London; The Grand Hotel, Leeds; The Dubai Hilton, and many more. More recently in 2005 it was announced that she would design a collection for the high street chain Topshop to be sold in 2006.

In 1987 he received the Oscar for the Best Foreign Designer from the Council of Fashion Designers, of America. In 1987 Lacroix left Patou, and started his own salon. He presented his first collection, sponsored by the Agache Co . Ltd. This was the first new Haute Couture Salon to be opened in Paris in two decades.

In 1988 he was awarded his second Golden Thimble. In 1989 he launched his first Pre-a-Porter collection. In 1990 Christian Lacroix launched his perfume \"C'est La Vie\" at a gala launching party. 1989-1990 Lacroix introduced his \"Luxe\" line.

During the Paris Fashion Week in October 2002, Christian Lacroix invited his friends to an intimate dinner, instead of a show. He showed pieces from his signature jeans and Bazaar lines and some vintage couture gowns. Everything shown proved that Lacroix is a versatile modern master.

He likes to use very bright colour combinations. His palette includes such colours as Magenta, Bright Pinks, Orange, Yellow, Reds, Blues and Greens, all sometimes in one outfit. His designs are easily recognizable because of their colourful nature. In this he was influenced by the sun of his native Province. \nHis silhouette is mainly used by trapezium and pyramid shapes, and thus the ultimate garment turns out to be long, loose and breezy. The look is predominately layered. He uses a lot of flowers to accentuate necklines, or hats, he uses ruffles, frills, and laces. He feels that embroidery is an integral part of couture, and he uses it lavishly. His embroidered patterns often imitate historic Spanish costume. He often incorporates gems into his embroideries, which are mostly made by renowned embroiderer francois Lesage. \nFurthermore he likes to use wool, mohair knit, leather, tweed, cottons, velvets, tartans, tapestry, crepe, satins, lame and printed fabrics. \nHe accompanies his designs, with such accessories as chunky jewellery, felt and leopard skin hats, patchwork capes, hoods, embroidered berets, fringed or striped scarves, studded or fringed belts, embroidered gloves, long necklaces, orange or gold boots, bejewelled crosses either hanging or incorporated into the embroidery design. \nHis bright palette and extravagant use of colour and fabric, have changed the otherwise rather darker, duller fashion trends of the time.

{"designer_name":"Carl Franz Bally","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/carl-franz-bally\/"],"biography":"  Carl Franz Bally was born in Schonenwed, Switzerland in 1821. In 1847 Carl Franz Bally and his brother take over their father\u2019s elastic ribbon and suspender manufacture. In 1851 Carl together with his brother founds \u201cBally & Co\u201d. in the Swiss hamlet of Sch\u00f6nenwald he employs German shoemakers who work in the basement of his own home, the \u201cHaus zum Felsgarten\u201d. The first shoes are still entirely handmade but their manufacture is based on the division of labour. After initial problems with production and quality, in 1854 a factory is built in the centre of the village. When his brother Fritz leaves the business, Carl Franz Bally founds the company \u201cC.F. Bally\u201d. First stores open in Bern, Basle and Zurich and exports to South America begin. In 1868 Bally builds a new elastic ribbon factory and a water channel to provide water-driven turbine power for the first MacKay Sole sewing machine. In 1870 C.F. Bally Co. is at the top of the European shoe industry because of almost entire mechanization of its production. The company quickly expands and opens branches in Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Geneva and Paris. Bally\u2019s shoes become more comfortable, graceful and fashionable, following strong influences from Paris. Though mass-produced, thanks to their excellent finish, quality of the material and refined decoration, Bally shoes already stand for luxury. As of 1880, Bally employs agents to sell its products in Alexandria, Barcelona, Beirut, Brussels, Bucharest, Cairo, Constantinople, Hamburg, Lisbon, Madrid, Marseille, Sofia and Vienna. In 1892 Carl Franz Bally hands over the business to his sons who rename it C.F. Bally and Sons. He died in 1898 but his son continued the business. Bally begins using machines to join the upper and lower while most of the work is still done by hand. After a major adaptation to the needs of the market, the British retail organization, the London Shoe Co., is founded and stores open at New Bond Street and Victory Street. Initially baby shoes and silk dancing shoes were exported. The years after 1900 are determined by an economic boom and free trade without barriers. Important markets are built up in France, Germany, Austria and Italy. In 1907 Bally becomes a publicly help company \u2013 C. F. Bally Co. Ltd. \u2013 with a majority stake still in family hands. The Bally realm expands continuously, new production sites in France, new factories in Dottikon and Niderg\u00f6sgen, tanneries in Argentina and retail stores in Switzerland are opened. In 1921 C.F. Bally AG is established as a holding company, comprising five separate divisions; retail, wholesale, production, tannery and real estate. Slowly the economic situation in Europe improves and Bally recovers form the crisis and increases both retail stores and production sites in all parts of the world. In Switzerland a retail sales company is founded, the Bally Arola AG. The world depression affects Bally\u2019s shoe production and exports. In 1942 C.F. Bally\u2019s home \u201czum Felsgarten\u201d is transformed into the Bally Shoe Museum. With the celebration of Bally\u2019s centenary in 1951 a period of boom years begins. Originally inspired by the elegant lifestyle of a luxury hotel, the Scribe, the ultimate men\u2019s dress shoe, joins the Bally line. The name derives from the prestigious Scribe Hotel in Paris, where Max Bally, grandson of C.F. Bally, resides during these years. As of 1965, increasing imports of low-priced shoes result in the saturation of the Swiss market and exports decline. Bally has to diversify and opens several industries, specialized in rubber, glues and other chemicals, which subsequently become independent. The company increases sales and extends its international distribution. As of 1976. Bally clothing handbags and other leather accessories are added to the product range.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["Masculin (M)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Bally"]}
{"designer_name":"Chantal Thomass","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/chantal-thomass\/"],"biography":"  Chantal Thomass was born in Paris, France, in 1947. \n Thomass had no formal training in fashion design, but as a child, dressing up proved enough of a motivation for her to design her own clothes, which were made by her mother. She began her fashion career at 18, designing clothes for girls of her own age. A year later, she married Bruce Thomass, who had studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Together they formed a small fashion company called Ter et Bantine manufacturing and selling young and unusual clothes. They created dresses from hand-painted scarves, designed by Bruce, and succeeded in selling them to Doroth\u00e9e Bis. Thomass also designed dresses with flounced pinafores, schoolgirl collars, and balloon sleeves that were sold from their first boutique on Boulevard Saint Germain in 1967. Actress and French cultural symbol Brigitte Bardot became a regular customer, as did designer Jacqueline Jacobson, who ordered over a hundred dresses in one season alone. \n   In 1967, she sold dresses made from handpainted scarves to the store Dorothee Bis. The business was sufficiently successful for the pair to found the Chantal Thomass label in 1975, with Chantal as creative director and Bruce as licensing and sales director. As the profile of the company rose, so did the price of the clothes, although they retained their young, enchanting, and highly feminine style. Thomass has often been motivated by the progression of her own life. Her pregnancy in 1981 led her to develop a line of maternity clothes. As her daughter began growing, Thomass developed a childrenswear division that retained many of the distinctive and theatrical elements of her mainline collections. The company moved into licensing in 1985, joining forces with the Japanese group World as a financial partner. Licensed products were available throughout Europe and Japan and included fine leather goods, tights, women's shoes, eyewear, watches, children's ready-to-wear, scarves, lingerie, and swimwear. There were soon a dozen Thomass boutiques throughout France. Thomass retains her eminence by reflecting fashion changes and adapting her look to suit the prevalent mood. A youthful feel to her clothes has kept her in the forefront of leading Paris-based designers. Yet the mid-to late 1990s were a turbulent time for Thomass. In 1995 she was fired from her own label, of which she owned a minority interest, in a dispute with Japanese majority owner World Company. World planned to continue the label, publicizing aggressive expansion plans, and released further designs, which were considered more commercial than Thomass' typical work. A year later, however, the label went into bankruptcy and liquidated its assets. Thomass, meanwhile, stopped designing lingerie for a time, leaving the category that had become her main focus. She spent the next four years as a consultant to companies such as Austrian hosiery maker Wolford (where she designed a swimwear line), Victoria's Secret, Antin\u00e9as, and Rosy, often in categories outside lingerie. In late 1998 after a lawsuit against World was resolved, Thomass reacquired the rights to her name and found a backer, the Dim division of Sara Lee, which took a two-thirds ownership of her company and assumed manufacturing duties for the core lingerie lines. Her first products under the relaunch were available in 1999. Her reentry into lingerie design was marked by controversy when a Galeries Lafayette window display featuring live models wearing her lingerie drew protests from feminists and other groups in Paris. Among the best-known designers in France\u2014a retrospective of her work at Marseille's Mus\u00e9e de Mode in 2001 included 230 pieces\u2014Thomass also has a strong business in Japan and began her entry into the U.S. market in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with her first Saks Fifth Avenue trunk show taking place in April 2001. Licensed lines, distributed primarily in Europe and Japan, include eyewear, among other categories.","the_look":"Chantal Thomass has built a reputation for her tantalizing, flirtatious clothes. Much of her work pays a titillating homage to exotic underwear; there is, however, never a blatant display of overt sexuality. Instead there is always a hint of the naughty schoolgirl or a sensuous allusion to the charms of the teenage seductress, like Carole Baker in Baby Doll or Sue Lyon in Lolita. The clothes are often fitted or skimpy, trimmed in frills, ribbons, and flounces, and always produced in the most sophisticated fabrics.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["2002 Chantal Thomass Eau de Parfum (W)","2004 Chantal Thomass Ame Coquine (W)"],"social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/chantalthomass","brands":["Chantal Thomass","Chantal Thomass Hosiery","Moncler"]}

{"designer_name":"Christian Dior","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/christian-dior\/"],"biography":"  Christian Dior was an influential French fashion designer. He was born on January 21, 1905 in Granville, France. When he was 5 years old, his family moved to Paris. From 1923 to 1927 he was studying and in 1927 he did his compulsory military service. \n In 1928 Dior and his friend Jacques Bonjean opened an art gallery on rue de la Boetie. In 1931 Dior's beloved mother died, his brother also died and his family became ruined financially. \n   He visited the Soviet Union and on his return found that his partner Bonjean had also become ruined. He fell seriously ill and left Paris for a year, returning in 1935. His friend Jean Ozenne gave him a place to stay and helped him to start sketching dresses and hats. Dior started to sell his sketches some of which were purchased by milliner Agnes. He also meets Robert Piguet, who bought some sketches, and some were published in \"Le Figaro\". In 1938 Robert Piguet opened a fashion house, and Dior took his first job, when he joined him as a designer. However as the war had started, he had to leave Piguet and joined the military after a year. In 1941 after military service on his return to Paris, he joined Lucien Lelong as a designer. At Lelong, Dior was happy, he could design more or less as he pleased and he could remain in the background, as he preferred to do, with his problem of shyness. In 1946, backed by textile magnate Marcel Boussac, he established his main house of couture in Paris. In twelve years he expanded his business to 15 countries and employed over 2,000 people. Dior is known mainly for the 1947 \"New Look\" which employed narrow shoulders, constricted waist, emphasized bust, and long, wide skirt. His designs represented consistent classic elegance, stressing the feminine look. 1947 Christian Dior perfume company is set up and he christens the first perfume \"Miss Dior\". Pierre Cardin joins Dior and remains there until 1950. 1948 Dior luxury ready-to-wear is set up in New York. It is the first of it's kind. 1950 Dior stockings, ties, all other accessories are marketed in the USA under licence. 1951 Dior furs opens in Paris. 1952 onwards Dior salons are opened in London, Caracas, and many other cities 1955 Yves St. Laurent becomes Dior's first and only designing assistant. 1955 Launch of Dior lipsticks and beauty products. In 1957 suddenly Christian Dior dies of a heart attack and Yves St. Laurent takes over as the firm's artistic head. The fashion world was stunned The house of Dior employed over 1200 employees, spread among 28 workrooms and it's own police force to prevent pirating. It was a million dollar firm and his death represented a very great challenge to the house of Dior and even France itself. But there was no need to worry. The house of Dior had within it two young designers who would ensure the future of Paris as the capital of fashion as well as the future of the house of Dior. One was Yves St. Laurent, who took over and presented a fantastic first collection, the Trapeze line and the other was Marc Bohan who followed YSL and remained nearly 30 years as head of Dior and himself had a very well received first collection the SLIM line. Yves St. Laurent came to the notice of Christian Dior through his friend Michel de Brunhoff. De Brunhoff was the chief judge of a competition set by the International Woold Secretariat in 1953, which was won by Yves St. Laurent, who submitted a design of an asymmetrically draped one-sleeved cocktail dress. De Brunhoff told Dior that he must take this young man into his salon, and although Dior was not initially keen to do so, when he saw his designs, he agreed. Dior only had one assistant throughout his life, and this was Yves St. Laurent. While he was at Dior, he designed many dresses which appeared in the 6-monthly collections, particuarly 'bubble dresses\" which were drawn in at the hemline on a band. Dior felt that he was not being recognized enough for his work and did have plans to give him more recognition, but he died before these plans could be put into place. Yves St. Laurent's first collection for Dior was called the \"Trapeze\" line and it was a great success. The newspaper headlines read: \"St. LAURENT HAS SAVED FRANCE, THE GREAT DIOR TRADITION WILL CONTINUE\" Yves St. Laurent presented 6 collections for Dior. His 1959 collection was not very well received because he raised the hemline to the knees, belted every waist tightly and pulled the skirt into a tight kneeband. YSL was not very concerned about the criticism as he said \"indignation is a good sign, it means fashion is alive and well.\" 1960 The Spring\/Summer collection was also very shocking, it was Beatnik, motor-cycle jackets made of alligator skin, mink coats with ribbed sweater sleeves and turtlenecks under finely cut suits. The staff at Dior felt YSL had misjudged the Dior clientele. In 1960, Yves St. Laurent was called for military service, and on his return he found that Marc Bohan had been given charge of the House of Dior. St. Laurent was very angry about this, and sued legally against Dior since he had a contract for the position with Dior. He was granted compensation of 48,000 pounds and used this to set up his own salon. 1960 Marc Bohan was 34 years old when he took over Dior. 1961 Dior under Marc Bohan presents the first collection the \"Slim Line\" which is very well received. 1967 Miss Dior ready-to-wear is opened in France, and a \"Baby Dior\" boutique is opened. 1968 Dior knitwear Co-ordinates is opened. 1970 Dior menswear is launched. 1973 Dior ready-to-wear fur collection is launched. 1987 Musee de la Mode presents an exhibition of Dior creations to mark the 30th anniversary of his death. In 1989, there was another change of designer at Dior. Gianfranco Ferre designed from 1989 till 1997 for Dior. The house of DIOR is still one of the most successful Haute Couture houses in the world. John Galliano took over in 1997 and brought a new creative image for the house of Dior. In 2001, Dior appointed Hedi Slimane as chief designer for Dior Menswear. In late 2001, Dior opened a new jewellery store in the Place Vendome in Paris, alongside all the leading jewellers Carter, Chaumet, Boucheron and Van Cleef and Arpels. The new store was personally set up by Victoria de Castellane who runs Dior's jewellery activities. John Galliano has set up a new Dior Baby store in London, opening it's doors in June 2005. All the smartest baby clothes will be available there, as well as designer Teddy Bears.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Gwen Stefani","Beyonce Knowles","Paris Hilton","Linda Evangelista","Nicole Kidman","Hilary Swank","Melania Knauss","Giselle Bundchen","Charlize Theron"],"perfumes":["1947 Miss Dior","1949 Diorama","1957 Diorissimo","1963 Diorling","1963 Eau Fraiche (W)","1966 Eau Sauvage","1972 diorella","1976 Dior Dior","1979 Dioressence","1980 Jules for men","1984 Eau Sauvage Extreme","1985 Poison","1988 Fahrenheit for men","1991 Dune (W)","1994 Dolce Vita","1994 Tendre Poison","1995 Eau Svelte (W)","1997 Dune for Men","1998 Eau de Dolce Vita","1999 Hypnotic Poison (W)","1999 J\u2019Adore (W)","1999 Lily (W)","2000 Eau de Dior Coloressence (W)","2000 Eau de Dior Energizing (W)","2000 Eau de Dior Relaxing (W)","2000 Diorever","2000 Remember Me (W)","2001 Fahrenheit Summer (M)","2001 Higher (M)","2002 Forever and Ever (W)","2002 Dior Addict (W)","2002 Dune Sun (W)","2002 J\u2019Adore Eau d\u2019Ete (W)","2002 Fahrenheit Summer (M)","2002 I Love Dior (W)","2002 J'adore Eau de Toilette (W)","2003 Chris 1947 (W)","2003 L\u2019Or J\u2019Adore (W)","2003 Fahrenheit 0 Degree (M)","2003 J\u2019Adore New Eau de Toilette (W)","2003 J\u2019Adore So Dior (W)","2003 Higher Energy (M)","2003 Lily Dior (W)","2004 Dior Addict Eau Fraiche (W)","2004 Fahrenheit Fresh(M)","2004 Eau Noire (U)","2004 Cologne Blanche (M)","2004 Boise d\u2019Argent (M)","2004 Pure Poison (M)","2004 Dior Me, Dior Me Not (W)","2004 Dior Addict \"Dior Twist\" (W)","2004 J`Adore Anniversaire en Or (W)","2004 J`Adore Summer Fragrance (W)","2004 L'or J'adore The Absolute Perfume (W)","2004 Sweet Sun (W)","2005 Miss Dior Cherie(W)","2005 Dior Homme (M)","2005 Dior Star (W)","2005 Dior Addict 2 (W)","2005 Eau de Dolce Vita by Dior (W)","2005 J'adore Adoration en or Limited Edition (W)","2006 Dior Addict 2 Logomania (W)","2006 Dior Addict 2 Summer Breeze (W)","2006 Forever and Ever Dior (W)","2006 Fahrenheit Summer 2006 (M)","2006 J`Adore Gold Supreme (Divinement Or) (W)","2006 Midnight Charm (W)","2006 Pure Poison Elixir (W)","2007 J\u2019Adore L\u2019Absolu (W)","2007 Dior Addict Shine (W)","2007 Dior Addict Summer Peonies (W)","2007 Dior Homme Intense (M)","2007 Dio Homme Cologne (M)","2007 Dior Passage No.4 (W)","2007 Dior Passage No.8 (W)","2007 Dior Passage No.9 (W)","2007 Eau Sauvage Fraicheur Cuir (M)","2007 Fahrenheit 32 (M)","2007 Fahrenheit Summer 2007 (M)","2007 J`adore Le Jasmin (W)","2007 Miss Dior Cherie 2007","2008 Cruise Collection - Escale a Portofino (W)","2008 Dior Addict 2 Summer Litchi (W)","2008 Dior Homme Sport (M)","2008 Elixir Hypnotic Poison (W)","2008 Elixir Midnight Poison (W)","2008 Elixir Pure Poison (W)","2008 Midnight Poison (W)","2008 Miss Dior Cherie 2008 (W)","2008 Miss Dior Cherie Blooming Bouquet (W)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Christian Dior","Christian Dior Haute Couture","Dior Homme","Dior Watch"]}

At the age of 13, Carolina was taken to Paris to see a Balenciaga fashion show, an event that she considers influential in how she looks at clothes. From then on, Carolina became involved in the total dressmaking process, working with the dressmaker or designer on choice of style, fabric, and fit. \n   Her sense of taste and style won many accolades, especially from friends who eventually became her clients. After many years on the International Best Dressed list, she embarked on a career in textile design. She arrived in the United States in 1980 with her husband and four daughters. Her friend, Diana Vreeland, former editor of Vogue magazine, convinced her to design dresses rather than fabrics. In 1981, she opened her business with a collection of twenty dresses. At first Herrera's clothes had the exaggerated sleeves and shoulder pads often associated with the Dynasty television show. She holds her fashion shows in Manhattan's Plaza Hotel. She launched her fur collection in 1984 and her CH Collection (a more affordable line) in 1986. Her bridal line was launched in 1987, after she designed Caroline Kennedy's wedding gown. Her perfume lines followed in 1988. Her empire grew so rapidly and steadily since its creation that she went on to dress Jacqueline Onassis for the last twelve years of her life.

{"designer_name":"Claude Montana","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/claude-montana\/"],"biography":"  The late Helse Dolsey once called Claude Montana the \"Leader of Paris fashion,\" but that could be said of many Paris designers. Another name for him has been \"King of Shoulder Pads\" which is a more apt title, looking to the size of the shoulders of many of his designs. He has spent a good deal of his career designing men's clothes for women. \n Fashion Designer Claude Montana was born in 1949 in Paris to a German mother and Catalanian (Spanish) father. At an early age, he traveled to London (1971) and began his career by designing papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 jewellery covered with rhinestones. He returned to Paris in 1970 and started working for a French leather company called McDouglas in 1972, where he learned the basic skills of pattern cutting\/grading. \n   In 1973, he designed a ready-to-wear leather collection in collaboration with Michelle Costas. His first fashion show took place in 1976 at Angelina\u2019s Tea Room, In Paris. His designs were acclaimed and his rise was meteoric. Montana's own ready-to-wear company was founded in 1979, and two years he later presented his first collection for men, called Hommes Montana, in which he focused on the colour and materials of each garment rather than trivial details. He opened his first boutique in Paris in 1983, and another in 1986. The Montana Fragrances Company was created in 1984. From 1990 to 1992, he designed haute couture collections for the House of Lanvin, but was eventually replaced by Dominique Morlotti as his designs were considered too bold. He won two Golden Thimble awards for his work at Lanvin. Montana, who greatly admired Mme.Gres (1910-1993) as a couturiere, specializes in strong colours, monochromatic fabrics, and lots of leather and wool. His classic and structural pantsuits feature razor-sharp tailoring and strong silhouettes with dramatic proportions. In addition to his own lines, Montana currently designs men's wear for Complice, an Italian company. In 1993 Claude Montana married his long-time girl-friend and earlier model, Wallis Francken - famous for starring in the Emanuelle films. They were married in Paris at the Mairie in the rue de Grenelle. The bride naturally wore a Montana outfit, a soft white crepe pantsuit. The designer wore a pair of beige and black Montana cowboy boots flown in especially from Mexico. During the late 90's Montana designed swim-wear and soft flowing gowns with a bias cut. In 1996, he brought out a line of Jeans called BEST MOUNTAIN made by his concern Best Montana. His beloved wife Wallis committed suicide in 1995. Montana faced considerable financial difficulties, and sold his house to a French concern, who are continuing the name. Stephane Parmentier took over in 2002. He had earlier worked with Karl Lagerfeld, Givenchy and Lanvin.","the_look":"Claude Montana is known for his refined, figure-hugging designs, in lightweight materials or heavy leather. \nHe was an avid colourist and favoured blue, red, metallic, and neutral tones, in luxurious materials such as cashmere, leather and silk.\nDuring the 90's, his style gradually changed and became more simple and sophisticated. His collections announced a whole new set of styles with exquisite drapery, fluidity, movement and minimal construction. He used a much more feminine look. Gone were the bulky masculine overcoats, and in came furs of white fox, or coloured mink capes, and he began to make liberal use of fabrics such as velvet, crepe, mousseline, and leather.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1986 Montana Light (W)","1986 Montana Light d\u2019Homme (M)","1986 Parfum de Peau","1989 Montana Parfum d\u2019Elle (for women)","1989 Montana Parfum d\u2019Homme (M)","1994 Suggestion Eau d\u2019Argent (W)","1994 Suggestion Eau d\u2019Or","1994 Suggestion Eau Cuivree (W)","1997 Just me","1998 Montana Man","2000 Montana Blue (M)","2001 Montana Homme (M)","2003 Montana Green (M)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Montana"]}

{"designer_name":"Catherine Walker","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/catherine-walker\/"],"biography":"Catherine Walker was born in France in June, in 1945. She established the Chelsea Design Company Ltd. In London in 1977 with no formal training in fashion design. Her educationl background was in philosophy, for which she took a Ma\u00eetre-\u00e9s-Lettres, roughly the equivalent to a UK doctorate. Walker claims the title of her company, which did not bear her own name until 1993, was in deference to her lack of experience as a fashion designer. \n The decision to start her own company was made when Walker was widowed in 1975 and left with two young children. She began making children\u2019s wear, and the transition to making maternity wear was in fact a natural one, according to Walker, since the pregnant female form resembles the generally shapeless figure of a child. Walker affirms that it was many years before she thought of herself as a fashion designer, and that it was a purely technical interest in the construction of garments which initially inspired her. \n During the first 12 years of business Walker consolidated her knowledge of pattern cutting, fitting, and sewing, and later couture dressmaking, and tailoring. As her reputation grew by word of mouth, she attracted press attention, and British Vogue first photographed one of her dresses for its January 1982 issue. Although the designer's clothes have been regularly featured in editorial fashion pages, Walker is renowned for her dislike of publicity and has never held a catwalk show. She views her personal development as a designer in a series of stages\u2014first dressing, then tailoring, followed by embroidered decoration and, finally, draping. \n   During her career, she has received two Designer of the year Awards, the first the British Couture Award in 1991 and the Glamour Award in 1992. She is an expert pattern cutter, fitter and seamstress. While the bulk of her business is the made-to-measure couture collection, Walker also produced a ready-to-wear range called De Luxe and has designed hats made for her by Mailson Michel in Paris. She designs both fine jewelry and a collection of costume jewelry, which include earrings and bracelets to accessorize the clothes. Walker also designs a collection of couture bridal gowns which she launched in 1986 with the opening of a second shop on London's Fulham Road. She, along with others, was responsible for designing the wedding dress worn by Lady Helen Windsor at her marriage in July 1992. Walker is perhaps best known for her creations for the late Princess of Wales, which attracted widespread publicity for her as a couturier, although she had always tried to avoid this aspect of the fashion world. She is also the designer from whom Princess Diana purchased the maximum number of clothes, often crating a complete wardrobe for her foreign tours. Catherine Walker started with some maternity dresses which Princess Diana ordered in 1981. When she discovered Catherine Walker, Diana found what she needed. A designer who would concentrate on her needs. The Frenchwoman was to provide most of her clothes for 15 years and always give her personal attention. She designed by far the majority of Diana\u2019s evening wear and this was reflected in tehe enormous number of her dresses that were sold in the Christie\u2019s Charity Auction in New York in 1997. Catherine's name is pronounced 'Catreen'. She is an intense, reclusive French woman with a doctorate in aesthetics and an informed interest in social history and art. Walker was aware of the responsibility entailed in dressing the Princess. Diana was sending signals to her public through her appearance. Catherine found new ways for the Princess to win support and during the 80's gave her a radiant mystique. As a French woman in London, Walker was at a distance from designer rivalry and fashion politics and was the perfect partner for the production of the 'Diana' image. After Diana's death, Walker was outraged when the Victoria & Albert Museum refused to display the Princess' gowns and dresses in 1999, mostly designed by Walker. Many Brits took this as an affront to Diana's memory, especially when the London museum had expressed interest in displaying a dress worn by Posh Spice, a member of the pop recording group Spice Girls, and one from Sophie Rhys-Jones was already on the premises. The imbroglio came a year after Walker published her autobiography, recounting her experiences dressing Princess Diana. Catherine Walker's impressive client\u00e9le, which listed not only British but foreign royalty, bears testament to her skill as a designer, despite the fact that she did not consider herself one for the first dozen years of her successful business.","the_look":"It is her tailoring and decorative use of beading that have become the hallmarks of Walker's designs. There is always an emphasis on the midriff, which Walker attributes to her French background. This structured effect around the waist, which though not fitted gives the illusion of elongating it, is apparent not only in her tailored jackets but on both day dresses and evening gowns. British journalist Lisa Armstrong, writing in the Independent (London, 16 July 1992), believes Walker's skill as a couturier lies in her ability to create clothes possessing the subtle, unlabored tailoring that on the surface seems not to be doing anything, but somehow manages to eliminate unwanted contours and add curves.\nAnother characteristic of Walker's designs is her use of plain colors such as black, navy, cream, and red, which are enhanced not through the use of printed textiles but with applied decoration such as hand-embroidery, heavy beading, and frogging. Her attention to detail is legendary; articles about the designer mention how she has been known to fly to Paris to find three buttons for a particular jacket.","who_wears_it":["Joely Richardson","Olivia Williams; Amanda Holden; Tasha de Vasconcelos","Emilia Fox","Lucy Liu to name a few as well as young members of the Royal Family","such as Viscountess Linley","Lady Helen Taylor","and Lady Gabriella Windsor."],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/catwalkerco","brands":[]}

Mrs C\u00e9line Vipiana, creator of the brand, is one of the rare legendary female company director who transmitted her personal dynamic energy to her brand. \n Mr and Mrs C\u00e9line Vipiana open their first boutique at 52 rue de malte in Paris in 1945, \u201cC\u00e9line, le bottier pour enfants\u201d. \n This luxury shoes boutique for children rapidly becomes famous thanks to the excellent quality of models, with custom-made soles, following the orthopedic instructions. \n   The Red Elephant is the first logo in 1950. The 60\u2019s underline the ready-to-wear launch and CELINE becomes one of the pioneers in the field of \u2018fashion for everyone\u2019. The unique sportswear approach of the brand provides a real added value and makes a name for itself in the history of fashion. The brand becomes extremely successful in 1963 with the INCA line and in particular, the best seller Inca, the flagship model of flat heeled moccasins and its matching bracelet Chantilly, both adomed with the famous CELINE \u2018horse-bit\u2019. In 1966, the shoe collection expends with another top of line model: The Byblos Moccasin. A strong code becomes the emblem of the brand in 1967, the American Sulky. Rebroduction of an American engraving from the beginning of the 19th century, Mr Vipiana notices it in a book published in New York in 1956, \u2018Handbook of Early Advertising Art Mainly from American Sources\u2019. The first Signature canvas was born in 1971, the C Sulky Canvas. Subtle mix between the C of C\u00e9line and the American Sulky, this canvas is still used and allows to easily identify the brand symbol. Mrs C\u00e9line Vipiana observes the motif of the chain that surrounds the Arc-de-Triomphe, on Place de l\u2019Etoile in Paris. She immediately recognizes in this symbol the ideal Parisian emblem for her brand. The same year celebrates the creation of the \u201cEtoile Shiert\u201d. Among the items that crates the emblematic C\u00e9line silhouette, like the skirt and the shirt, the trench has also been one of the brand leading product from the very beginning. In only 3 years, CELINE expends its business on an international level thanks to the openings of its 7 first boutiques abroad: Monte Carlo, Geneva, Hong Kong, Rome, Lausanne, Toronto and Beverly Hills. In 1987, the brand possesses 87 boutiques offering a worldwide fame. In 1988 Peggy Huynh-Kinh is appointed Artistic Director and becomes the key designer that makes the brand evolve and grow. The sportswear chic leather oriented collection created for Winter 88, is seen like a \u2018coming back to roots in a modern way\u2019. The same year celebrates the opening of the registered office at 38 Avenue Montaigne, in Paris. In 1997 Michael Kors is appointed Designer for the CELINE ready-to-wear collection for women before becoming Artistic Director in 1999. His collections emphasize the particular know-how for leather creations. He succeeds to push the modern femininity in a very luxurious spirit. Created in 2002, the Boogie Bag is the essential fashion accessory for the CELINE women. This bag represents timeless simplicity and Parisian luxury. This handbag shows the meticulous details and expertise applied by CELINE in creating its fine leather goods. In 2005, Ivana Omazic is appointed Artistic Director of the brand and accepts the challenge of giving a new expression to the CELINE spirit. Her first Spring-Summer 2006 collection is a realy success. She succeeds in making the brand recognizable thanks to a feminine, elegant and modern touch, coming from the CELINE Sportswear couture heritage. 2007 underlines the celebration of the 35th anniversary of the famous Celine Blason. The double C symbol and chain represents the Celine House and can be traced back to the early Seventies when its founder, C\u00e9line Vipiana, had a fashion vision that was to become a legend.

{"designer_name":"Charles James","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/charles-james\/"],"biography":"Charles James was born in Sandhurst, England in 1906. He briefly attended the University of Bordeaux in France, before being sent to Chicago in the USA, by his family, to word for a utilities magnate in architectural design. He resigned almost immediately since he was not interested in that line of work. \n In 1926, he opened a hat shop \"Charles Boucheron\". In 1928, he moved to New York and took up dress designing and in 1929 he began commuting between London and New York. His clientele included Millicent Rogers, Coco Chanel and Diana Vreeland. His designs are so timeless that his 1932 culottes for the New York department store Lord and Taylor, were still being sold in the 50's. \n In 1934 and 1935, James worked in Paris under the patronage of PAUL POIRET, designing fabrics for French textile manufacturer Colcombet. \n   New York became James base from 1940 to 1947 and during part of that period, he designed clothes for Elizabeth Arden's salon. He showed one of his most successful collections in Paris in 1947. In the 50's he spent most of his time in New York. James looked upon his dresses as works of art, as did many of his customers. Year after year, he reworked his original designs, ignoring the seasons. The components of the precisely constructed designs were interchangeable so that James had a never-ending fund of ideas from which to draw. He is most famous for his sculpted ball gowns made in lavish fabrics and to exacting tailoring standards, but is also remembered for his capes and coats, often trimmed with fur and embroidery, his spiral zipped dresses and his white satin quilted jackets. James was very temperamental and continually sabotaged his own success, but the lush structural beauty of his clothes have ensured he will be remembered as one of the greatest designers. After the birth of his son, he also produced a children\u2019s collection. He designed the interior and several pieces of furniture for the Houston home of John and Dominque de Menil. After returning to New York City form Paris, Scaasi worked for James for two years. Charles James retired in 1958 and died in 1978. In the year 2001, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Charles James was one of those honoured, and here is a picture of his plaque.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Charles Frederick Worth","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/charles-frederick-worth\/"],"biography":"Though born and raised in England, Charles Frederick Worth became the first world famous French fashon designer. He was also the first to create and emply the principles of design and fashion that would be called \u201chaute couture\u201d or \u201chigh fashion\u201d. Worth not only designed clothes for much of Europe's nobility and many American millionaires, he also introduced many modern changes in the ways clothing was designed, made, and sold. Worth was born in 1825 in Lincolnshire, in the east of England. His father was a lawyer who had lost most of his money gambling, so young Charles was forced to go out to work when he was only eleven. He worked for many years at a department store, then at a company that sold fabrics. Through his sales experience he learned about what women wanted and needed in clothing and fashion. He wished to become a dress designer, so at the age of twenty he took a job with a fabric firm in Paris in 1846, where he could study design while he worked. \n It was there that he introduced his first new idea of offering dress design to customers at the fabric company. For the first time, ladies could get the whole dress, design and fabric, at the same location. \n In Paris he was hired by Gagelin and Opigez, well-known Parisian drapers. While worling in their shop, he married one of the firm\u2019s models, Marie Vernet, a young woman of elegance and charm. He persuaded Gagelin to open a dress department which was a great success. \n   Paris, at that time, was full of female dressmakers who indulged in random frivolity. Worth realized that aesthetic perfection must be built on a foundation of technical excellence. He was the first to sign his work and the word \"couturier\" had to be invented for him. His wife inspired his creativity and he designed her dresses which attracted the attention of Gagelin's customers and led to orders. Gagelin included several Worth dresses in their display in 185l at the Great Exhibition at London's Crystal Palace. Worth, by now a junior partner in the firm, urged his partners to expand into dressmaking, but they hesitated to risk their reputation in a business as low-class as dressmaking. Worth found a wealthy Swede, Otto Bobergh, who was willing to bankroll the venture and opened the dressmaking establishment of Worth and Bobergh in 1958. Worth was soon patronized by the French Empress Eug\u00e9nie and after that by many titled, rich, and otherwise notable women, Cora Pearl, the famous demimondaine, and Pauline de Metternich, an Austrian princess and musical patron, were Worth devotees. So Worth came to design all the Empress' official court clothing and his label wore the royal crest. For the next decade Worth designed clothes for most of the royal ladies of Europe. He also dressed actresses such as Sarah Bernhardt. Many of his customers travelled to Paris from other countries, coming from as far away as New York and Boston. Much of his work is associated with the movement to redefine the female fashion shape, removing excessive ruffles and frills and using rich fabrics in simple but flattering outlines.Worth re-defined the nature of the relationship between the garment's purchaser and it's maker. Before him, even the most skilled and talented dressmakers were regarded as servants in circles that determined social prestige, placed much lower n the social ladder than painters or architects. Firstly, he was a man, a couturier, successfully imposing himself on the hitherto female and low-prestige world of the dressmaker. Secondly, he was able to get his clients to come to his house, rather than the other way around, just as a patron might visit an artist's studio. Thirdly he proved himself a master, not only of formal court clothing but also of the more witty, fanciful and often historically-based show costumes, modeled on famous paints or commissioned for masquerade balls. He was catering for those who liked to be conspicuous. Under Worth's leadership, haute couture became a luxury business, as well as an interface between the silk and brocade manufacturers of Lyons and the world of the aristocracy and the Court, but also a vehicle for publicity which favoured both the client and the couturier. More than any other person, Worth can be said to have presided over the popularity of the crinoline. From the 1840's onwards, skirts grew larger and larger. Worth designed and delivered these huge creations, but he really did not like them at all. He enlisted the aid of the Princess de Metternich to launch a new shape. He flattened the skirt in front and swept the fullness around to the back, forming a bustle. This new shape caught on fast, and by the 1880's became almost architectural. The crinoline slowly went out of fashion. Worth always boasted \"I am the man who dethroned the crinoline.\" He followed the bustle with the Princess line, which evolved into the fashions of the turn of the century, known as \"Fin de Siecle\" styles. Worth's copious use of luxurious fabrics throughout the 19th century, inspired the silk manufacturers of Lyons to weave more and more interesting textiles. Worth was a gifted designer, who seemed to have had a clear understanding of the times in which he lived. He was able to dress both royalty and high society, as well as the demi-mode such as actresses Sarah Bernhardt and Eleonora Duse, with equally affluent taste. He died in 1895 and passed Maison Worth on to his sons Gaston, who ran finances and Jean Philippe, who was the designer. In 1900 there was a display of haute couture at the Paris Exposition Universelle, and Worth, Callot Soeurs, Doeuillet, Paquin and Redfern all took part. Maison Worth continued to provide gowns for grand and traditional affairs, right up to the 1950's. Throughout the decades, Worth salon reflected the taste of the times, including \"Art Nouveau\" and woven\/printed flowery fabrics. They also made many gowns inspired by great paintings.","the_look":"Worth used beautiful and luxurious fabrics for his dresses, and he trimmed them with rich decoration, such as fringe, lace, braid, and tassels made of pearls. His many important contributions to design included an ankle-length walking skirt, shockingly short for its time, and the princess gown, a waist-less dress that hung simple and straight in the front while draping in full pleats in the back.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1932 Je Reviens (W)","1930's Dans La Nuit (W)","1966 Monsieur Worth (M)","1976 Fleur Fraiches (W)","1976 Requete (W)","1977 Miss Worth (W)","1981 Monsieur Worth (M) (new version)","1985 Dans la Nuit (W) (new version)","2002 Worth by Worth (W)","Launch date unkown - Impudence"],"social_media":"","brands":["Charles Worth"]}

{"designer_name":"Charles Dana Gibson","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/charles-dana-gibson\/"],"biography":"Charles Dana Gibson was born on September 14th, 1867 in Roxbury, Massachusetts, USA into a happy family of modest means. His father was Charles DeWolf Gibson, a Civil War lieutenant, his mother Josephine Elizabeth Lovett. The family came from New England ancestors stretching back to the early settlers. Charles had an older brother and three younger sisters. \n He took the entrance exam for the Art Students League and passed it. He studied at the Art Students League in New York from 1884 to 1885. \n He first worked with paper cut-outs and silhouettes, before turning to pen and ink drawings, the first of which he sold in 1886 to the humorous weekly Life for four dollars. He began to pick up other small commissions and there was a notable improvement in his work. \n   Gibson became interested in the technique of an English draftsman Phil May, who had developed a very economical pen style. Gibson learned to use a longer stroke, and soon moved into a scintillating technique unique in the world of pen and ink. Five years later, in 1891, Gibson's drawings were Life's star attraction. From 1886 to 1889, he worked for the weekly Tid-Bits (which later became TIME magazine) as well as Collier'sWeekly, Harper's Monthly, Harper's Bazaar, Scribners and many other publications. From the 1890's, Gibson chronicled the lives of his fellow Americans through his patriotic, romantic and often satirical drawings. For 20 years, from 1890 to 1910, Gibson created a girl character who was tall, slender, poised and modern. She was known as the \"Gibson Girl\". She wore her hair piled into a Chignon or tucked under a plumed hat. She wore a starched blouse and long, flowing skirts. She represented the modern, active woman and was sometimes shown in shorter skirts, especially when cycling or engaged in sporting activities. In the USA, she was thought to be inspired by Irene Langhorne, who married Charles Gibson in 1895. In England, she was personified by the American actress Camille Clifford, who first appeared on the London stage in 1904. Some people also thought her to be similar to Alice, the daughter of President Teddy Roosevelt, and that she might have been Gibson's inspiration. The Gibson Girl image became immensely popular. She appeared on wallpaper, clothing, and was used by manufacturers of corsets, skirts, shoes and household items. She inspired songs and revues. Younger women tried to model their clothes, their gestures, their hair and their features on the Gibson Girl specifications. Gibson's girl had a tremendous effect on the fashions of the time. His pictures carried a message of hope but the dreams could not last, they were dissipated by the explosion of World War I. Gibson threw all his pictorial energy into patriotic propaganda, but at the end of those 4 long years, the world was a different place. His special world has vanished. His skill remained, but it was a disillusioned era. He continued to illustrate to some extent, but then took on the burden of editing Life. In his later years, he retired to his island home in Penobscot Bay and painted. Charles Dana Gibson died in 1944 at the age of 77.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

She fell into fashion design by accident. She made bikini swimsuits for her friends and offered one to a store in San Francisco, who ordered 1,000 for immediate delivery. \n She opened a boutique in San Francisco, then worked as a freelance designer before moving to New York in 1972 and opening her own salon. \n   She worked with the design team of Joan and David in the 1980's. She has also given advice and training to several up-coming designs like Gemma Kahng who was with her from 1979 for several years.

Traditional Korean clothing has inspired many of her simple shapes. She is especially noted for her creative handling of silk. \nCathy Hardwick has designed ready-to-wear for the audience she knows best\u2014the modern career woman with an active lifestyle. There is a certain spirit and success about Hardwick's designs that come from this defining relationship to the clothing and its purpose. Hardwick's collections consistently offer women clothing with ease and simplicity, appealing to the young and young-minded spirit of the confident, self-assured businesswoman. Her clothing is not merely a somber uniform, but rather has an air of wit and sophistication that makes it fun, worn by the stylish young woman who is secure with her life and is moving in a positive direction. \nHardwick's design success has been a result of the masterful execution of her pure and basic principles\u2014neutral colors and simplicity of form. By centering her collections around neutral colors and relating the colors of current collections to previous ones, the wearer can develop a wardrobe of pieces that work together.

Her clothing reflects her lifelong exposure to and depth of understanding of the fusion of Eastern and Western styles. The chinoiserie elements in the designs seem to be a part of the total vision and philosophy she has about clothing rather than a motif simply applied to Western fashion. In her first formal show in New York in 1974, Hardwick showed obi style wrapping in the closures of her skirts and trousers along with Oriental prints and accessories. In 1975, she showed the effectiveness of shaping a \"Big Dress\" with an obi-inspired tie. Earlier Hardwick incorporated frog closures in her mandarin collared jacket for a more direct use of the Eastern look. The mandarin collar and frog closures were used again in her spring 1994 collection on light and easy shaped tops.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Christian Louboutin","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/christian-louboutin\/"],"biography":"Christian Louboutin is a well known French shoe designer. \n Christian Louboutin was born in Paris in 1963. His obsession with shoes began in 1976 when he was 13 years old, when he visited a Parisian museum and saw a huge red high-heeled shoe worn by another visitor. He never wanted to work in fashion, he dabbled for a while in landscape gardening and was interested in the stage instead but he discovered there was no money to be made. But he adored shoes and says \"nobody wears shoes like a dancer on stage.\" So he decided to devote himself to fashionable footwear. \n Louboutin felt personally bothered by this sign and, as a consequence, he would draw shoes with compressed buckles and with soles. He admits to having spent a lot of time as a Teenager drawing these types of shoes in his school notebooks. These shoes would become the base of Louboutin's sales as a designer. \n   Later on, Louboutin began attending parties and dance halls in Paris, offering his shoes to women at these events and venues. Most of the ladies rejected his shoes, claiming to have no money. He first trained with Charles JOURDAN and freelanced for Chanel and Yves St. Laurent with his shoe designs. He also met the great shoe designer Roger VIVIER and helped him organize an exhibition of Vivier's work. Christian Louboutin paints the soles of all his shoes bright red, regardless of their colour. The actual heel of the shoes leaves a red rosette imprint behind. He calls them his \"follow me\" shoes. Such other sellers as American company Neiman Marcus began to sell Louboutin's designs. Louboutin shoes also have a trademark red leather sole, making them instantly recognizable. Louboutin designed this provocative prototype of the 'Egg' pump in 1988 to focus attention on what he feels is the most sensual, yet ignored, part of a woman's foot - the inside curve of the arch. In 1991, he opened his own shop in the Passage Vero-Dodat in Paris, which soon caught the attention of Parisian socialites visiting the neighbouring antique dealers. His velvet pump drapes the ankle with net and tassels inspired by a belly dancer's veil, in the 1990's. In 1996, Louboutin designed a range of shoes with transparent Lucite heels, in which flower petals or other objects were seen to be floating. These were very popular and sold in large numbers. For one customer the French film star Arielle Dombasle, he enclosed love letters from her philosopher husband within the plastic heels, as well as a lock of his hair and a quill. She says: \"his shoes are unique, each one is like a jewel.\" Louboutin loves to let his imagination run wild. He has many plans for the future, including his own perfume, and will almost certainly make his dreams come true. Christian Louboutin currently has 3 boutiques in the United States. Two can be found in New York. One location is Downtown on Horatio Street and the other is on Madison Avenue. The third location is in Beverly Hills, California.

One of his paintings \"La Grande Route\" from 1920 shows the influence that the Impressionists artists had on his work. In 1923, when Vogue published photographs of it's accredited illustrators, Monvel was shown as one Vogue's French artists posted in Paris. He seemed to be regularly contributing to Vogue throughout the 20's. He was a talented portraitist, painting George Marie Haardt in 1924 and Alfred Cortot in 1927. He made several studies for portraits, and below on the left, is one of a young girl made by him in 1928. In the early 1930's Monvel painted several buildings in New York, such as a view of Wall Street, and high rise buildings. He continued painting up until his death. He died in an aeroplane accident in 1949 at the age of 65. A retrospective exhibition of the work of Bernard Boutet de Monvel was held on 30th June 2001 at the Fondation Mona Bismarck in Paris. A book of his work has also been published, it was written by Stephane-Jacques Addade, and shows more than 300 coloured reproductions of his paintings and illustrations.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Carl Oscar August Erickson","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/carl-oscar-august-erickson\/"],"biography":"Carl Oscar August Erickson was born in Joliet, Illinois, USA in 1891 of Swedish parents. He attended Chicago's Academy of Arts for two years, and left around 1909. \n His first job was for Marshall Field, Lord and Thomas and other advertising accounts in Chicago. He shortened his name to \"Eric\" for his artistic work. He worked for several years as a commercial artist and sign painter before moving to New York in 1914, a young man in his 20's. For 5-6 years he made a living of sorts as a freelance commercial illustrator. \n In 1916, his first illustrations appeared in Vogue and by 1925 he was a regular contributor to the magazine, specializing in drawings of people in fashionable settings. \n   In 1920 he married his wife Lee (who was also an illustrator) and moved to Paris. This was to be their post until the 2nd World War began. By 1930 or so, he was as important as any artist on the staff. His illustrations were lively, fluid and confident, in contrast with the flat linear styles of the other 1920's artists in the fashion field. In his fashion sketches, he stressed the importance of detail. Eric was nearly 40 in late 1930 when he designed his first cover for Vogue. It is shown here on the right. An impressionist style, the briefest of brushstrokes, a black glove dominating the pink background. From then on, he gained in confidence and sophistication but his style remained his own. Eric always drew from life, never from memory, imposing agonies of immobility upon his subjects. The lightness of his touch belies the efforts of study and application and identifies him as a remarkable draughtsman in his special field. When the Fall of France came, Eric and his family were in Paris. They escaped through Bordeaux and reached New York, which remained his base for the duration of the war. His illustrations lightened up the war years for the readers of American Vogue. Eric was part of Vogue for more than 35 years. His drawing, in Vogue's own words was \"to the Paris couture, the most desired of representations for their designs.\" He had an undeclared rivalry with Vogue's other great illustrator Willaumez but they were always complementary to each other, each lighting up the other's virtues with his own. The elegant drawing on the left is from 1957 a year before he died. Eric continued working for Vogue magazine until his death in 1958 at the age of 67 after an illness that over his last few months had prevented him from working with his habitual regularity. The Brooklyn Museum in New York held a retrospective exhibition of his drawings in 1959, a year after his death. The Parsons School of Design also hosted a major retrospective of Eric's work in 1964. It now maintains his fashion illustrations for people to study.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Cuthbert Collingwood Tinling","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/cuthbert-collingwood-tinling\/"],"biography":"Teddy Tinling, was a British tennis player, fashion designer, spy and author. He was a firm fixture on the professional tennis tour for over sixty years. \n Cuthbert Collingwood Tinling was born in Eastbourne, England in June 1910. His nickname was \"Teddy\". \n In 1923, suffering from bronchial asthma, his parents sent him to the French Riviera on doctor's orders. It was there he began playing tennis, particularly at the Nice Tennis Club where the then biggest star of the game, Suzanne Lenglen, would practice. Despite Tinling's youth, Lenglen's father asked him if he would umpire one of her upcoming matches and he would go on to be her personal umpire for two years in between a short career as a player himself. This friendship with Lenglen led him to his first Wimbledon Championships in 1927, where he became player liaison until 1949. \n   At the age of 21, he opened a fashion house in London and during the 30's, his innovative designs for tennis star Suzanne Lenglen attracted many other tennis clients. He joined the British army in 1939, reopening his house on his demobilization in 1947. During the War he was a Lt. Colonel in the Intelligence Corps in North Africa and Germany. In 1949, his name became famous when he designed a pair of frilly lace panties for American tennis star Gertrude \"Gussy\" Moran to wear at Wimbledon under her Tinling-designed tennis dress. Tinling was involved in tennis throughout his life, working for the Lawn Tennis Association and other tennis bodies, mostly in the field of public relations. He was 6 ft. 6 inches tall, by the way. Tinling designed dresses for almost all of the great lady players throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. It was a design in 1949 - lace tennis panties - that led him to being asked to take leave from his position at Wimbledon. From 1952 to the 80's, he dressed most of the internationally famous women tennis stars, both on the court and off, using bizarre fabrics such as crush resistant tweed, for some of his designs. He tried another stunt at Wimbledon in 1958, dressing Carol Fagero in gold lame panties, but the authorities never let them on the court. Teddy wrote several books on Tennis and the personalities he had met. One was \"Love and Faults\" mentioned below, written in 1979 and another was \"White Ladies\" written in 1963 about the lovely Tennis players dressed in white. In 1975, he moved his business to Philadelphia in the USA, where he was just as successful. Tinling was openly gay. He wrote several books on tennis in the 1980s but respiratory problems continued to affect him and he died in 1990 at the age of 80. After his death it was revealed he had been a British Intelligence spy during World War II. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1986. Tinling's brother James Collingwood Tinling was a member of the team that built the first jet engine.","the_look":"Tinling turned instead to the new phenomenon, sportswear. Standard wear at the time for women on the tennis court was a blouse or jersey and a pair of culottes, an outfit which Tinling thought utterly lacking in femininity or style. \nHis designs were controversial from the outset\u2014Tinling's first commission, for Joy Gannon's Wimbledon debut in 1947, was a dress with a small colored border at the hem. A similar design the following year for champion Betty Hilton's Wightman Cup match so outraged Hazel Wightman she threatened to ban color\u2014if not Tinling\u2014from future Wimbledon games. Into this brewing storm blew Gertrude \"gorgeous Gussy\" Moran. Could Ted, she wrote from California, design her a dress for Wimbledon? A very colorful dress?\nTinling correctly predicted that an all-white rule would prevail for the 1949 games and so he designed instead a dress in proper white of satin-trimmed rayon, which shimmered, he said, as did Moran herself. Came the fitting, it was apparent that a pair of panties would be required to complete the ensemble. As legend has it, Tinling finished off the pants with a bit of lace edging and with this act inadvertently secured his place in fashion history. \nTinling's clothes, however, were not banned, and they continued to provoke Wimbledon officialdom as they continued to bring a sense of flair and glamour to center court. Tinling had an easy rapport with the stars of the game. He designed to suit the playing style and personality of the players he came to know so well, matching fabric, trim, and cut to the individual. \nWithin the profession Tinling was respected as the supreme arbiter who represented players to management in an official capacity not only at Wimbledon, where he was reinstated in 1982, but at the other three Grand Slam events as well as on the Slims tour. His encyclopedic knowledge of tennis and tennis players made him an oral historian of the game, and keeper of its traditions. For six decades Ted Tinling and tennis were synonymous.","who_wears_it":["Suzanne Lenglen","Gussy Moran","Carol Fagero","Martina Navratilova","Chris Evert","Evonne Goolagong and Virginia Wade"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Christian Berard","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/christian-berard\/"],"biography":"Christian B\u00e9rard, also known as B\u00e9b\u00e9, was a French artist, fashion illustrator and designer. \n B\u00e9rard and his lover Boris Kochno, who directed the Ballets Russes and was also co-founder of the Ballet des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, were one of the most prominent openly homosexual couples in French theater during the 1930s and '40s. \n Christian Berard was born in Paris, France in 1902. As a child, he was fascinated by the theatre and ballet and compiled albums of costume and scenery designs. He attended the Academie Ranson from 1920 to 1923. He first exhibited at the Galerie Druet in 1924. \n   By the end of the 1920's, he was an influence on and an inspiration to several fashion designers, notably Christian Dior and Elsa Schiaparelli. All throughout the 30's, Berard was illustrating the witty colourful designs of Elsa Schiaparelli. Though painting was his first love, he concentrated during the 1930's on fabric and interior design, as well as book and fashion illustration. His work appeared in Harpers Bazaar was instantly recognizable by his free, elliptical style, indicating elegant shape and form without severe delineation. In 1935 he appeared at Vogue. He was one of the great Bohemian characters of Paris. Still only in his early 30's, he was already the darling of salon, theatre and caf\u00e9 alike, a central figure of the artistic demi-monde. Of all Vogue's artists he is the one most widely celebrated in the journals and documentation of Vogue itself. They called him \"Bebe\". He was indeed an extraordinary figure: fat, unpredictable, unpunctual, depressive, addicted to opium, but lively, witty, and a charmer. He was an adventurous colourist. His use of light\/dark combinations, though initially considered avant-garde, later became acceptable and even fashionable. In 1945, Haute Couture was almost dead, and needed something to breathe life back into it. Christian Berard designed a set that showed Paris in its former splendour. Robert Ricci, son of designer Nina Ricci and others persuaded a group of 53 great couturiers to dress about 200 wire dolls of 27\" high for an exhibition. The clothes were exquisitely detailed miniature couture designs by Balenciaga, Madame Gres and many others. Starting at the Louvre Museum in Paris, this exhibition toured Europe and the United States, to great acclaim, and was one of the reasons for the revival of Haute Couture after the war. In the mid-80's, this exhibition was again discovered and sent around the world. Berard's sets were one of the reasons for the success of the exhibition. Vogue magazine published a great many of the drawings of Berard from 1935 till his death in 1949. On the right is one of his Vogue covers from 1939. He illustrated most of the leading designers of the time, including Vionnet, Revillon, Creed and Jean Patou. After the war, Vogue had a problem finding illustrators. Christian Berard was the most conspicuous loss to the magazine, and perhaps the most surprising, after all the efforts to secure him before the war. But his heart was evidently torn between painting itself, pure and private and the more public pre-occupations of designing for the theatre and the cinema. His collaboration with Jean Cocteau produced masterpieces, and La Belle et la Bete is a kind of monument. Some of his later work did appear in Vogue magazine after World War II, but the last single spread at Christmas 1948, was barely two issues before his obituary, and was the first he had supplied for 16 months. Christian Berard died in 1949, at the young age of 47.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

Clare was given the role of completely reinventing the brand, which she did, presenting her first collection in February 2006. Her first collection with Pringle was effortless and delicate and approached knitwear in a modern way. Each dress was constructed from a single five-meter length of ultra-fine silk yarn, knitted in a lace, which was then draped and wrapped around the body in a seamless piece. 2007 saw her win the award for Scottish Cashmere Designer of the Year at the Scottish Fashion Awards. She also launched Pringle 1815, a diffusion line named after the year the company was founded.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/clarewaightkeller","brands":["Pringle Of Scotland","Pringle 1815"]}

{"designer_name":"Caroline Charles","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/caroline-charles\/"],"biography":"Caroline Charles was born in 1942 in Cairo, Egypt, of English parents who were staying there at that time. She attended Swindon School of Art, Wiltshire, England until 1960. She then became an apprentice to Michael Sherard followed by almost two years working with Mary Quant. \n She set up her own design business in late 1963 and during the 60's proved to be a popular designer of young, fashionable clothing. Among her clientele were Cilla Black and Barbra Streisand. She designed min dresses and mini skirts in pure cotton and flannel. During the 60's she also worked as a broadcaster and journalist alongside her fashion work. \n From the tunics and trousers of the late 60's, she moved with ease to the long, flowing fashion lines that predominated in the early 70's. Using beautiful, luxurious prints and patterns, she established herself as a designer of more sophisticated clothes. \n   After such an auspicious start in the 1960s, she reflects that the 1970s were \"a terrible time for fashion.\" But the 1980s saw her in full swing again, attiring the newly married Prince of Wales in a tartan suit for the Braemar games and an oatmeal wraparound dressing-gown coat for a walkabout in Wales. She became one of the exclusive breed of \"Royal Designers.\" The exuberance of the swinging 1960s had given way to a more classic, sensible look. Charles has an eye for lavish fabrics combined with easy wearability. Hers are beautifully-made clothes with simple accessories; she hopes her clients would wear them to the supermarket. Her many illustrious clients, Lady Lloyd Webber and Dame Diana Rigg among them, have attested to the beguiling quality of her fabrics: perennial velvets, rich wool paisleys and elegant brocades, and, in the 1990s, black leather mixed with flippy lace skirts (a slightly vampy departure for the designer) toned down into wearable sexy party clothes. The 1990s have seen yet another phase of extremely successful, well-thought-out business expansions. A new flagship shop in Bond Street, and with it an entirely new Bond Street customer, opened up a whole new market for Charles. Caroline Charles has been invited over the years to be a design consultant to major Brands such as Burberry and Marks and Spencer as well as having design collaborations with major accessories and textile companies. Carolyn Charles has been a very popular designer for many years since. In 2002, she received an OBE from the Queen, for her services to British fashion, which is very well-deserved.","the_look":"Her collections are essentially practical and are based on the idea of a cohesive working wardrobe. She has enjoyed nearly 40 years in the fashion industry by dressing women specifically for a big event. Her signature black-tie luxury of sumptuous velvets, sequined silks and lavish embroidery is indelibly associated with clothes for the mother of the bride, speech day at college or Ascot. \nFluid jersey separates have also long been the anchor of her original Caroline Charles London label and their flexibility and interchangeability are exploited in all her recent collections.\nClothes that can make the leap from office hours to a cocktail party are not easy to balance, but Charles works through this difficulty by staying true to her tried and tested principles, a stark silhouette subverted by furious prints and lush fabrics.","who_wears_it":["Diana","Princess of Wales","ringo Starr","Petual Clark","madame George Pompidou","Barbra Streisand","Lulu","Marianne Faithfull","Mick Jagger","Cilla Black","Jodie Kidd","Naomi Campbell","Claudia Schiffer","Kristin Scott Thomas","Andie McDowell","Emma Thompson","Helen Mirren"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/carolinecharleslondon","brands":["Caroline Charles"]}

A leader in the American jewelry trade in the nineteenth century, he was known for his jewelry expertise, created the country's first retail catalog, and, in 1851, he introduced the English standard of sterling silver. \n His son, Louis Comfort Tiffany, was a decorative glass and lamp designer famous for his stained glass windows and art glass. \n In addition to his business, Tiffany was a patron of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and one of the founders of the New York Society of Fine Arts. \n   Tiffany's Upper East Side townhouse, designed by McKim, Mead, and White, once stood on the current site of the Ralph Lauren Polo Sport boutique across from the now-famous Rhinelander Mansion. Born in Killingly, Connecticut on February 15,1812, Tiffany was educated in a district school and in an academy in Plainfield, Connecticut. Starting at the age of 15, he helped manage a small general store started by his father, the owner of a cotton-manufacturing company. Charles Tiffany later worked at the office of his father's mill. The Tiffany family descendend from Humphrey Tiffany, who had lived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1660. In 1837, with $1,000 borrowed from his father, Tiffany and a school friend, John B. Young, set up a small stationery and gift shop in New York City. Their first three days in business brought them only $4.38 in total sales, but two years later they were still in business, selling glassware, porcelain, cutlery, clocks and jewelry. On November 30, 1839, he married John B. Young's sister, Harriet Olivia Avery Young (1816 - 1897) with whom he had two children, Louis Comfort Tiffany and Annie Olivia Tiffany (Mrs. Alfred Mitchell; mother-in-law to Hiram Bingham III). The store expanded in 1841 and changed its name to Tiffany, Young and Ellis. It established a reputation for selling only the finest goods and specialized in Bohemian glass and porcelain. It also began manufacturing its own jewelry. In the early 1850s, the company was reorganized under the name Tiffany and Company and opened branches in Paris (1850) and London (1868). The store also relocated uptown to a Fifth Avenue location in that decade. Tiffany was terribly embarrassed in an 1872 diamond and gemstone hoax perpetrated by Philip Arnold that cost investors more than half a million dollars. Another great achievement in his life was when he teamed up with Thomas Edison and together they created foot lights and other ways of electrically lighting theaters. As a result of this, Broadway and other shows became more popular during that time. The firm acquired and sold some of the French crown jewels in 1887, firmly establishing its reputation. At his death in Yonkers, New York on February 18, 1902 at the age of 90, Charles Tiffany's company was capitalized at more than $2 million and acknowledged as the most prominent jewelry company in North America.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Tiffany Co"]}

{"designer_name":"Cornelia James","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/cornelia-james\/"],"biography":"Cornelia James devoted her life to the design and production of high quality gloves, and was glove-maker to the Queen. \n Cornela James was born in Vienna, Austria on 11 March 1917. At the age at 21, under the threat of Nazism, she had to leave Vienna and escaped to Paris, taking with her as much leather as she could handle, her head full of designs and ideas. Shortly afterwards she came to England in 1939, to await a visa for the United States. Instead she met Jack James and within six weeks they were married and all thoughts of America disappeared. \n She spent the Second World War doing occupational therapy for wounded soldiers, teaching them the handcraft skills of glove-making, a subject she had studied at the Vienna Art College. \n   With her feel for colour she quickly realised that the post-war, rather drab, \"utility\" clothing could be brightened by wearing colourful gloves, and Cornelia James Ltd was born. In those early days she concentrated on snappy designs and brightness. This new approach was soon rewarded: both the royal couturiers, Norman Hartnell and Hardy Amies, were attracted to her designs and in 1947 she was asked to make the \"going-away\" gloves for the then Princess Elizabeth after her marriage to Prince Phillip. The following spring Cornelia James launched a range of leather gloves in 100 different shades and became known as \"the Colour Queen of England\", a title which delighted her. By the early 1950s, she was employing 500 people at her Brighton factory and was selling her gloves to all the large department stores in Britain and world-wide. Even the downturn in the demand for dress gloves did not defeat her: she turned to the production of silk scarves in distinctive designs and colours and also produced corporate neckwear. In addition, her love of gloves led her to seek new outlets, mainly in the worlds of theatre, television and film and she also continued to make gloves for the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Princess Royal. In 1979 she was honoured by the grant of a Royal Warrant as Glove Manufacturer to the Queen. She was a very active member of the National Association of Glove Manufacturers, always ready to put forward her ideas for the betterment of the industry as a whole, and was a strong advocate of the export markets. She was forever thinking ahead to her next \"collection\", always searching for new ideas, new materials, constantly striving to keep gloves to the fore - a somewhat frustrating task, particularly in these days of casual fashion. She became a Member of the Worshipful Company of Glovers in 1989, at the same time receiving the Freedom of the City of London. She supported the Livery Company in its many activities, supplying gloves for the annual Glove Personality Award and for the various charities supported by the company. Through gifts of gloves and scarves she also supported many charity events in Brighton and Hove, in particular the Heart Unit at the Sussex County Hospital and the Martlets Hospice, where she herself faced her end with great courage, dignity and humour. Cornelia James died in Hove, East Sussex on 10 December 1999. The glove world has lost one of its great characters in \"Nellie\", as Cornelia James was affectionately known. She loved entertaining and was a perfect hostess.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/cornelia_james","brands":["Cornelia James"]}

{"designer_name":"Dirk Bikkembergs","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/dirk-bikkembergs\/"],"biography":"  Dirk Bikkembergs was born on January 2, 1959 in Bonn, Germany. After his high school career, Dirk Bikkembergs was interested to attend law school but eventually decided to start studying at the Royal Academy of fine Arts in Belgium. In 1982 Bikkembergs graduated, together with \"The Six\", other Belgian designers Ann Demeulemeester, Dries Van Noten, Dirk Van Saene, Walter Van Beirendonck and Martin Margiela. \n After his studies, Bikkembergs started working for Belgian fashion designers to earn himself some experience. \n   1985 was the year of Bikkembergs' breakthrough as he won the influential Golden Spindle award for Best Young Designer in Fashion. Due to the publicity he received by winning this award, Dirk Bikkembergs received the opportunity by a Belgian shoe company named Monarca to create his own shoe line for men. His very first collection, which consisted entirely out of shoes, was launched the next year in 1986. Finally in 1989 his first ready-to-wear men\u2019s collection arose, followed four years later by the female equivalent. This collection was the first Italian produced Bikkembergs' Collection. Dirk's quality collections and rising popularity gave him the opportunity to become more and more self-reliant. The partnership helped Dirk successfully establish in 1992 his women\u2019s line. For the next five years his shows grew and market size widened enough to warrant introducing an alternative line. Bikkembergs (white label) was soon introduced to the market, a collection which addresses a wider market. Since 1987 Dirk\u2019s perfect vision of a man has been one in a white t-shirt, \u2018501\u2019 jeans and simple trainers. A pair of jeans in particular have always been one of his goals, the ultimate challenge, something he felt should be kept until he believed he had enough expertise, resources and confidence. Only recently did he feel ready to invest all his efforts and experience into the project. At the Pitti Uomo Trade Fair in Florence Italy, where he was a special guest in June 2000, Dirk launched a new collection: Bikkembergs Jeans and Street wear (red label). Central to the launch was the G8 jean. Dirk has spent the last 15 years modelling a creative spirit. At the start of 2000 Dirk extracted one drop from all the work done in the past to be as concise as he could be. Dirk sees not just a new range of clothes but a genuinely new philosophy to bring clothes close to their purest form: garments without any relation to fashion terms, seasons, or even time. His clothes and shoes are a statement which will not fade after six months, but which will endure for years. The extracted drop will start a new era of purity, a renaissance, a cleansing process or re-prioritising. the label The Brand encompasses three separate lines, each offering clothing, footwear and accessories. The Dirk Bikkembergs black label collection embodies the values expressed in Dirk\u2019s work as a whole: health in mind and body, but at a more exclusive level. The mix of futuristic technology and artisan handwork defines. The second line known simply as Bikkembergs white label collection, was originally conceived (1996) as a response to market demand for more basic and more accessible styles in relation to the first line. It hat since evolved into a full diffusion line, which can be described as casual city wear with a distinctive fashion edge. Bikkembergs Sport as a distinct line was officially launched for the spring summer 2004 season, although Dirk had developed the Sport motif and had experimented with a football concept within other lines as early as 1999. Bikkembergs was later recognised as one of the original \u2018Antwerp Six\u2019. The son of army partes , Bikkembergs gained valuable.","the_look":"Dirk Bikkembergs try to illustrate that the masculine strength in men also exists in women. The women stripped away any macho elements from the men\u2019s collection and illustrated that the men\u2019s strength becomes one of sexiness, power and confidence when translated for women. For the first shows the women joined the man on the stage and walked together, even wearing essentially the same garment but with a fit for women. Macho strength manifests itself into sexy power for women with their identity and femininity maintained, indeed strengthened.\nThe collection, Bikkembergs (white label), inherits the very essence of \u2018Dirk Bikkembergs\u2019, with the same strength, character and performance. A parallel collection of timeless recognisable signature pieces defined through Dirk\u2019s vision of cut and innovative use of fabrics. From the beginning it has never been perceived as a second line and it has a distinctive personality on its own. It is more relaxed and less designed. It is a more accessible collection of alternative, simplified, basic and technical pieces which are made to precise standards with attention to a quality finish and casual detail. The person who wears \u2018Dirk Bikkembergs\u2019 should also wear \u2018Bikkembergs\u2019. It is the same man. A \u2018Bikkembergs\u2019 t-shirt under a \u2018Dirk Bikkembergs\u2019 jacket. \u2018Dirk Bikkembergs\u2019 provides the roots and everything else branches out from there. \nIn his red label dirk had spent much of the previous two years sculpting and diligently refining a pair of denims. The result is a pair of jeans that are strikingly human, in contrast with the irrevocably industrial feel of the last decade of denim. This human aspect has always been an obsession for jeans designers but somehow they always managed to miss the point: from stone washed to industrial-soiled, manufacturing has been aimed solely at recreating the \u2018used\u2019 quality, but the essence of a used pair of jeans can\u2019t be copied. Dirk has given his jeans a body and soul, a skin and a history. \nDirk has now made his message clear. By proving he can make innovative clothes in a uniquely structured shape. By being so assured with the man he wishes to dress, Dirk\u2019s collections have always been strong, vivid and liberal, almost elaborate, but this creative generosity helped make his message clear, there was no water in the wine.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dirkbikkembergs","brands":["Dirk Bikkembergs","Bikkembergs"]}

Dolce, who studied fashion design and worked for his family's small clothing factory, grew up in a small Sicilian village, while Gabbana, a trained graphic designer, grew up in Milan. \n Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana first met in Milan in 1980 when working as assistants in an atelier in Venice. They began to do freelance design in 1982, when they began doing business together. \n   In 1985, they showed their first major women\u2019s wear collection in Milan entitling it \"Real Women\". Their earliest designs consisted of unstructured clothing with complicated systems of fastenings. The collection was practically home-made, with all the family pitching in to help out with the tailoring. Four years later, they revealed their premiere menswear collection and opened a women\u2019s boutique in Milan. By 1987, inspired by classic southern Italian cinema of the 40's and 50's, they created a collection marked by romanticism and voluptuousness, the full skirts, ruffled blouses and lace shawls of Cicilian women, met with immediate success. They used religious themes, rosary beads, little black dresses, headscarves, and fishing village baskets to support this theme. Their inspirational figures include Italian actresses Sophia Loren and Anna Magnani. In 1988, Dolce and Gabbana signed an agreement with the Kashiyama group for distributing their designs in Japan. Also in 1990, they started designing for the Complice line for the Genny Group in Milan. In 1991, Madonna popularized their rhinestone-covered bodice. They have been awarded the Woolmark Award in 1991 and the Best Feminine fragrance of the year in 1993. They are the number one designer of choice in Hollywood.

Their first collection launched to international acclaim in 1986, and it wasn\u2019t before knitwear (1987), beachwear (1988), lingerie (1989), and accessories were added. Dolce & Gabbana are very popular for their designs in the Hollywood industry. The company is based in Milan. Its first store in the United States opened in March 1995 in the upscale shopping mecca \"the Galleria\" in Houston\u2019s fashion district. Since then, a boom in interest in their clothes has called for openings of their boutiques in other major cosmopolitan cities all over the world. Their boutiques have became a symbol of high fashion and couture. Dolce & Gabbana is organized into two central brands. \"D&G\" and \"Dolce & Gabbana\" D&G generally forms the groups more casual lines with cheaper prices. Dolce & Gabbana centralizes on haute couture and espensive price tags. Within each brand is \"Beachwear\" and separately \"Dolce & Gabbana underwear\". Earning remarkable financial success (despite the prevalence of fraudulent D&G merchandise), the duo even crossed over into the music world, recording a techno single in 1996 with the words \"D&G is love.\"","the_look":"Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s aesthetic is anything but coy: They will gleefully squeeze as much excess as is humanly possible into each showstopping piece - whether a jacket, dress, or suit.

In 1968, Daniel Tribouillard decides to create for Leonard his first collection of silk jersey garments and in 1970, the first exclusive Leonard boutique is opened in Paris. In 1975, the first collections of produce under licence are conceived. In 1984 Tribouillard presented his first collection in Japan, after designing a line of kimonos. He was the first westerner ever to design Japanese kimonos. The politic of licence is asserted in 1985 and it will enable Leonard to intensify the multiplication of exclusives boutiques all over the world. In 1987, Daniel Tribouillard buys out the Jacques Leonard's Group as well as subsidiary companies and becomes Chairman the same year. In 1992, Leonard started the Menswear line. And, in 1994, Leonard joins the French Couture Federation. The strategy for developing the name Leonard has been fruitful and the Leonard Group has doubled the international turnover and two news boutiques are created in Macau and Bangkok in 1997. In 1995 to celebrate the first Shanghai International Fashion Festival, Daniel Tribouillard went to China and presented his collection of colourful flowered garments there. It was a great success.

{"designer_name":"Dante Trussardi","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/dante-trussardi\/"],"biography":"  In 1910, Dante Trussardi, master glove-maker, set up his company in Bergamo, Italy, creating finely made gloves which were soon sold all over the world. Nicola, Dante Trussardi's nephew was born in Bergamo in 1942. He studied at the Universita Cattolica in Milan, graduating with a degree in Economics and Business Science. He married Maria Luisa Gavazzeni. They had two sons and two daughters, Beatrice, Francesco, Gaia and Tommaso. In 1970, Nicola Trussardi, took over the company after the sudden death of his father and brother. Taking full advantage of the company's experience with leather work, he decided to diversity the company's products. He bought a tannery and with the help of experts studied new procedures for treating and refining leather to make sophisticated products. In 1973 Trussardi launched his label for bags, suitcases and small leather goods. He used as his logo, the greyhound dog, fast and delicate, which has always been tied to the history of painting. The immediate success of the first leather collection encouraged him to add more products to the line, such as belts, shoes, umbrellas and ties. \n In 1976, the first Trussardi shop was opened in Milan selling leather jackets and other leather goods. Today the network of shops in Italy and abroad includes 183 boutiques. \n   In 1983, Trussardi presented the first womens ready-to-wear collection during the twice yearly Milano Ciolezioni shows. He chose as a setting, the romantic ambience of La Scala Opera House in Milan. He followed this a year later with his first Menswear collection shown at the Modern Art Pavilion in Milan. The Trussardi look is classic, but innovative, with generous use of the finest fabrics. 1983 was the year of the debut of the pret-a-porter collections, with a show at Teatro alla Scala in Milan. In the meantime Trussardi also applied his sense of beauty and functional quality in the field of design, creating objects for personal use, as well as an elegant bicycle, and rethinking the styling of motorcycles, car interiors and even aircraft interiors. In both 1985 and 1986 Trussardi was awarded the Iminagena Italia award. In 1987 Trussardi designed the leasure garments for the Italian athletes taking part in the 1988 Olympic Games. Throughout the 1980's, the menswear and womenswear collections were very successful, and the company was doing very well. However, sadly, on April 3rd, 1999, Nicola Trussardi died. He crashed his car on the way home, went into a coma and did not recover. He was only 56 years of age. His daughter Beatrice and son Francesco carried on the house. French designer Nicolas Ghesquiere took over the design helm for 2 collections in 1997, followed by Jeremy Scott, a Paris-based American, who joined in 1997 and designs Trussardi Jeans, Trussardi T-Store and Trussardi Sportswear. The Nicola Trussaudi Foundation has been set up to host exhibitions and cultural events in keeping with Nicola's love of art and culture. In 1999 Beatrice and Francesco Trussardi approached the task of moving forward with the entrepreneurial program of their father, while immediately bringing their own personal, innovative touch to the identity of the maison. The group's management takes on a dynamic, innovative approach, in tune with the times.  In January 2003, after only 4 years running the company, 29 year old Francesco Trussardi, who had taken over the Trussardi house on the death of his father, was himself killed in a road accident in Northern Italy. This was a terrible tragedy. In spite of the death of Francesco Trussardi, the house of Trussardi presented their Fall 2003 collection during Milan Fashion Week in March 2003. It was very well received. It included splashes of orange and turquoise pony skin, zigzag patterns in leather skirts. The only sad note came when the crowd gave an ovation in support of Francesco's sister Beatrice Trussardi, when she came out alone on the runway.

She studied fashion at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, before moving to New York in 1986. For some time she worked in a giant warehouse sorting second hand clothes for thrift-shop dealers. \n Next she went into costume design, working on about 20 films, including \"My cousin Vinnie\". \n Along the way Daryl married Paul Leonard and had two children daughter Liadan and son Fionn, but she hasn't let it slow her down. \n   In 1991, she set up shop in the East Village. She says \"everyone said I was mad, nobody but tramps went down there\" but word spread and a nearby record shop called 99X helped to attract a more design-conscious crowd. She now has a Daryl K line, her main line, and a diffusion range K 189. Kerrigan was determined to design the perfect pair of Jeans. Her boot-cut hipster jeans, dubbed \"low riders\" were partly inspired by 70's hiphuggers she found in the vintage warehouse. These jeans were to make her name and become the mainstay of her collections. In 1996, she was awarded the CFDA Perry Ellis New Talent Award for womenswear. She also makes stretchy tube tops, drawstring nylon skirts and zip-up jersey sweat jackets. She makes white jeans out of washable stretch microvelvet. She prefers to use washable, easy to wear fabrics. In London, her clothes are seen at Browns and Harvey Nichols stores. Her Fall 2001 show was held in a massive warehouse on West 26th Street, in New York. It was the ideal location for the queen of downtown cool with awe-inspiring views of the city. A tough chic theme was interspersed with pretty schoolgirl minis and turtlenecks. Kerrigan's models were dressed to kill. Just prior to this, the Leiber group (then called Pegasus Apparel) acquired her Daryl K and K-189 labels. But the luxury fashion group stopped distribution of garments from her Fall 2001 collection and closed her stores in New York and Los Angeles. However, Daryl refused to lay down and die. She repurchased the rights to her name and launched her label once again with a small capsule collection at Henri Bendel in October 2002. Her offering for Fall 2003 included affordable basics and more refined pieces. She is recreating herself with a sexy, superfocused collection. In 2004 she also reopened her store in New York, which she lost two years ago.

After leaving Parsons, he began his career as a sketch artist and window dresser for such stores as Lord and Taylor. He attracted the attention of Dorothy Shaver, the store's president, who hired him to design a clothing line that year. \n At the same time, he started working for the first of many ready-to-wear companies whom he joined during the 1950's culminating wioth a position at Townley Frocks, run by Claire McCardell. In 1958, when Claire McCardell died, Donald Brooks took over the designing for her Townley Frocks label as well as under his own label and in the early 1960's he also began working as a costume designer for films and the stage. \n   In 1962 while still at Townley, Brooks designed an Empire-waisted dress in hot pink silk shantung. The dress is shown here on the left. Mrs Kennedy wore it on a tour of India in 1962, when she took a cruise on the river Ganges.

He opened his first store in 1963. From 1961 he has been a designer for theatre, film, and TV custom clothing. His first broadway show \"No Strings\" in 1963 won a Drama Critics Award.

{"designer_name":"Donna Karan","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/donna-karan\/"],"biography":"Donna Karan is the premier fashion designer and perhaps the most influential to appear in America in many years. Karan's impact on the world of fashion is reflected in the fact that she sells more than $ 150 million per year. Furthermore she is also the createro of the DKNY (Donna Karan New York) clothing label. \n Donna Ivy Faske was born on October 9, 1948 in Forest Hills, New York. She grew up in Hewlett, Long Island with her step-father who was a tailor and her mother who was a model. \n In 1962 she dropped out of school, and started selling clothes at a neighbourhood boutique. After 4 years, in 1966 she enrolled in the prestigious Parsons School of Design. \n   She married Mark Karan in the early 1970s and had a daughter Gabrielle, nicknamed Gabby. Karan\u2019s daughter Gabby is married to Gian Paolo De Felice, an Alitalia airline pilot. They have one daughter, Stefania. She has been reported as being involved in the Kabbalah Centre. She was divorced in 1983 and married her childhood sweetheart sculptor Stephan Weiss. Karan, nicknamed The Queen Of Seventh Avenue, began working for Liz Claiborne at a very young age. In the 1970s, she then got a job through her mother as an intern with Anne Klein, where she was eventually promoted to associate designer in 1971. A couple of months later, she was fired because she said \"I was so good, that Anne Klein felt insecure and could not stand me in the design room.\" Karan's talent drew the attention of Patti Cappalli head of a label called \"Addenda\" and it was under her tutelage that Donna Karan developed as a designer. Karan worked with Cappalli for 18 months. In 1970 Donna Karan returned to Anne Klein. When Anne Klein herself died in 1974, Takihyo Corporation of Japan became the new owner and Karan, together with her former classmate and friend Louis Dell\u2019Ollio, became head designer of the house. Donna Karan and her Parsons classmate Dell 'Olio made Anne Klein into one of the biggest and most profitable designer sportswear companies in the USA. She collected 3 Coty Awards (The American Fashion Designer's version of the Oscar) during the time she was with Anne Klein. In 1984 Donna Karan left Anne Klein and, together with her husband Mark Karan and Takihyo Corporation she started her own business \u201cto design modern clothes for modern people\". She showed her first Donna Karan women\u2019s collection in 1985. What made her initially famous in the industry was her line of elastic bodysuits. She also became known for her very successful Essentials line, initially offering seven easy pieces which could all be mixed and matched, and created a fully integrated wardrobe. At a time when more and more women in America entered the business world and were looking for sophisticated and elegant, yet simple and functional clothing, preferably in black, white or grey, the company experienced tremendous success with its \u2018power dressing\u2019 outfits and was loved by the critics in the 1980s. Ms. In 1988 Karan extended her women\u2019s Signature Collection by a less expensive line, called DKNY, for younger women. The line was such a hit that Karan can be regarded as the first designer to successfully establish a bridge collection. Two years later she created DKNY Jeans and DKNY for men was launched in 1992, one year after the Signature collection line for men had been presented. The portfolio was later complemented by a kid\u2019s collection, beauty products, accessories and furniture. Sales rose up to 510.1 million in 1995 from $96.6 in 1991. More than half of the sales are attributed to the DKNY lines, couture contributes 15% and about 30% of the sales are generated by men\u2019s clothing, accessories, cosmetics and other products. Almost a third of the sales are made in exports. In April 2001, LVMH the French giant concern headed by Bernard Arnault, bought out Donna Karan financially, although she continues as Chief Designer. It will have to be seen how this affects her operations. Another event in 2001 occurred which will affect Donna tremendously. Her beloved husband Stephan Weiss died of cancer. He had been ill for some time. Donna had received his complete support and advice throughout her career and will sorely miss him.","the_look":"Karan is inspired by New York; she believes its energy, pace, and vibrance attracts the most sophisticated and artistic people in the world, the type of people and lifestyle for whom she has always designed. Her principle is that clothes should be interchangeable and flexible enough to go from day to evening, summer to winter. Fashion should be a multicultural language, easy, sensuous, and functional, a modern security blanket. Perhaps this explains why her fundamental trademark items, the bodysuits, unitards, black cashmere and stretch fabrics and sensuous bodywrap styles owe great allegiance to the innate style and taste of the artist.\nThere is a great sense of urgency about Donna Karan; to say there are not enough hours in a day would be an understatement. Karan's magic touch is a combination of creative flair and marketing know-how. She designs for human needs, people who live, work, and play. She conceptualizes a customer and wardrobe and can then merchandise a line, applying her designer's eye for color, proportion, and fit. In many ways she is like a contemporary American Chanel in that she analyses women's needs with a question to herself: \"What do I need? How can I make life easier?

His first memorable work was a painting that he and his mother completed: a representation of the tree of knowledge and the sun, with an illustration of his mother holding him up to observe the glorious objects of the world.

{"designer_name":"Emanuel Ungaro","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/emanuel-ungaro\/"],"biography":"  Emanuel Ungaro has been one of the most innovative and colourful of today's couturiers. \n Emanuel Ungaro was born in 1933, of Italian parents. His father Cosimo Ungaro was a tailor who fled fascism to raise his family in France. Ungaro and his 6 siblings were brought up in a lively country house where food and enjoyment were ever-present and to this day, he says, \"I think in French, but I laugh in Italian.\" \n   Ungaro moved to Paris in 1955 and worked for Balenciaga for six years and realizing a long dream of becoming a couturier with the Master. In 1961 he quitting to working for Balenciaga and joined Courreges, designing many of the 60's metal outfits of that house. Courreges was a leading couturier of the 60's and Ungaro's designs were very popular. In 1965, he opened his own couture business. 1968 Couture in Paris and Rome, had discovered hardware and Ungaro was thoroughly metal minded. He put his models into metal bras. By August he was the leading metal-merchant with body sculptures, and body jewellery. 1970 onwards, Ungaro's work became softer and less rigid. Clothes were made in boldly printed fabrics which have now become his trade-mark. He pays great attention to detail in order to enhance colours, patterns and textures of clothes. 1970 He introduced his first perfume \"Diva\" The design of the bottle was inspired by one of his draped garments. During the 70's he introduced long pants, pastel leather coats, drawstring dresses, elasticised shirring on jackets and sensuous fabrics. He inherited exquisite workmanship from his mentor Balenciaga and started to reinforce a silhouette which would be recognized as his own. He obtained his printed fabrics first from Nattier and later from Sonja Knapp. He also showed modernistic geometric renderings of the Kimono, with wide sashes at the waist and necklines slashed to the sash. During the 80's Emanuel Ungaro progressed to blooming of forms. He liked dresses which impose themselves by the sheer beauty of the volume they created. Colour had a large influence on him and his palette moved across the spectrum. In the 90's Emanuel Ungaro has maintained his own style, but also moved out into lacy and feminine designs, as well as using animal prints for many dresses, in combination with laces. Several of his outfits used geometric prints as well as intricate embroidery inspired by historic clothes. 1988 At the age of 55, Emanuel Ungaro married Laura Bernabei and they have a daughter. They live near where he was born in Aix-de-Provence, in a converted farmhouse. He has been assisted by his Florentine wife Laura in recent years. the label Today, Ungaro has a very flourishing atelier as well as branches all over the world, and his annual turnover is approx. $ 700 million. In 1996, Ferragamo took over financial control of the Emanuel Ungaro house. Emanuel Ungaro has continued to design couture for his house, but the Spring 2002 was his last for ready-to-wear. He has passed the torch to a young designer named Gianbattista Valli (born 1967). Valli has worked for Roberto Capucci, Fendi and Krizia before joining Ungaro in 1997. He has been trained by Emanuel Ungaro to take over the design of the house. However, Ungaro has stressed in several interviews that he has no intention of retiring from design of couture. He is still brimming with creative ideas. At the end of October 2004, Giambattista Valli announced that he would be leaving the house of Ungaro and starting up his own label. The house of Ungaro announced that the new ready-to-wear designer would be Vincent Darre. Vincent was born in France in 1961 and has worked with Prada, Chloe and Fendi. Since 2002 he was chief designer at Moschino. The house of Ungaro was owned by the Italian house of Salvatore Ferragamo. However in November 2005, Ferragamo sold Ungaro to a USA California-based venture capitalist Asim Abdullah who made his fortune in computer software and e-commerce. The sale includes garments, mens and womens fragrances and accessories. After the announcement, Emanuel Ungaro announced his retirement from designing. He has not been actively involved with the designing for the last six months apparently. Plans for the designer at present there, Vincent Darre, have not been discussed.","the_look":"His debut was rapturously received, Twiggy and Penelope Tree were photographed by Avedon wearing Ungaro masks. Other popular outfits were leather jackets with hot pants, and pop socks, quilted leather jackets with jockey caps and thigh-high boots, and chain mail dresses with metallic bustiers. Ungaro was the son of a singing tailor, and music has been his inspiration. So his designs are created to an accompaniment of classical music in his salon. This has led to his genius for draping and flowing gowns. His Italian upbringing and love of the country side, has led to his use of a wide range of colours. These are bright, floral, and scintillating. He uses a wide range of fabrics, prints and textures with an impeccable cutting technique. As far as embellishments are concerned, he has in recent years, used more lace and intricate embroidery on his garments.","who_wears_it":["Nicole Kidman","Angelina Jolie","Cate Blanchett","Diane Kruger","Lucy Liu","Elizabeth Hurley","Kristin Chenoweth","Uma Thurman","Kylie Minogue","Penelope Cruz","Liz Hurley","Iman Bowie","Callista Flockhart","Emmanuelle B\u00e9art","Juliette Binoche","Patricia Kaas","Shiva Rose","Mary J.

He spent two years at Milan University, before moving to the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, USA for a further two years of study. \n In 1934 he was a member of the Italian Olympic ski team. In 1937, he won a skiing scholarship to Reed College in Oregon. There he majored in social sciences and received his MA two years later in 1939. He made his first venture into fashion by designing the uniforms for the Ski team. \n   Being born into an aristocratic family, he was the first Pucci to actually work in over 1,000 years. But he spared his family honour by signing his work only as \"Emilio\". Returning to Italy, he spent the war years as a bomber in the Italian Air Force. He was awarded a doctorate in political science from the University of Florence in 1941. Pucci was a keen sportsman and as a high school student had been a member of the Italian Olympic ski team. After World War II, in 1947, he was photographed by Toni Frissell of Harper's Bazaar on the Italian ski slopes, wearing ski pants of his own design. The magazine asked him to create some winter clothes for women, which it subsequently published and which per put on sale in various New York stores. In 1949, Pucci opened a boutique in Capri, selling the range of his interesting items but especially \"Capri Pants\" which took the world by storm. In 1951, the first fashion show took place in Florence. During the 50's, Pucci gained a reputation as a designer of brilliantly patterned sporting wear and relaxed daywear. He contributed to the success of post-war Italian fashion design. He used silk jersey for his dresses which were light weight, wrinkle free and supremely comfortable. In addition to his life of fashion, Pucci was a well-known fascist and wrote a defense of the Mussolini regime as an undergraduate at Reed College. In 1965 he became a member of the Italian parliament. Also in 1965, Pucci was hired by New York ad agency Jack Tinker and Associates to re-design the hostess wardrobes for Braniff International Airways. In 1959, Emilio Pucci married Cristina Nannini, and their daughter Alessandro was born the same year. Their second daughter Laudomia was born in 1961. In 1962, Pucci's first haute couture collection was shown, and he mentioned that it was homage to Jacqueline Kennedy. In the 60's he produced tapered trousers, Capri pants, shorts, resort dresses, silk blouse and shirts, slacks and casual suits. He also designed ranges of underwear, sweaters and swimwear for US manufacturers. His clothes were known for their brilliant colours and well-defined prints. He led the way for the colourful revolution of the 60's. Pucci's designs have reached strange places. The Apollo 15 space crew carried a Pucci-designed flag for planting on the moon. In 1977, he designed the Lincoln Continental Mark IV for the Ford Motor Company. In 1989-1990 there was a sudden boom on Pucci prints again. In 1990 Emilio Pucci retired from active design work. On behalf of her father, his daughter received the Council of Fashion Designers of America Award in New York in 1991. The following year, the Costume Museum in the Palazzo Pitti in Forence displayed some of Pucci's most famous pieces. He died in 1992 at the age of 78. The clothes which Emilio Pucci designed over the years are valued immensely and vintage gowns are treasured. Many exhibitions are held, which was very well attended. the label Emilio Pucci: a story which began in 1947 with the chance photograph of a woman in an outfit on his design, is still evolving. His 30 year old son, the Marchese Alessandro Pucci di Barsento, took over the running of the family business and estates. However, sadly, Alessandro was killed in a car accident in 2000 near Florence, Italy. For a while his sister Laudomia handled the creative designing. The house of Pucci still however goes on reviving the fashion house's glory days to make it relevant for a new generation. Capitalizing on Pucci's bold, instantly recognizable prints, The Pucci revival has been gathering momentum for several years. The Pucci family began launching new products to appear to these new fans. Finally, the company was sold to luxury goods conglomerate LVMH who own Dior, Givenchy and many other houses. In November 2000, LVMH president Arnault asked Puerto Rican designer Julio Espada to reconceive the Pucci clothing collection. Espada, in his Spring 2002 collection, showed plenty of pretty girly shorts, scarves and short crisp cotton dresses. Espada left Pucci in April 2002. This decisive step has already begun to enhance and reinvigorate the remarkable potential of Emilio Pucci. In addition to the historical Emilio Pucci boutique in New York, newly designed stores, stretching across the globe form Palm Beach to Saint Moritz to Bangkok. First unveiled in 2001, Emilio Pucci furniture collections, conceived yearly in co-operation with renowned furniture designer Cappellini, mark a brilliant return to design. In mid 2002 famed French designer Christian Lacroix was named Artistic Director at Pucci. Pucci is opening the doors of it's new Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York on September 7th 2004, and throwing a party which will be the highlight of New York Fashion Week. It has been announced that after Christian Lacroix completes his Spring\/Summer 2006 collection for the house of Pucci, the design will be taken over by Matthew Williamson from the Autumn\/Winter 2006 collection.","the_look":"The Italian marquis, Emilio Pucci, whose elegant sportswear has become a status symbol, is among the post-WWII couturiers who made the world conscious of the distinction of Italian design.  After the war, there was a great hunger for colour, novelty and newness.  The simplicity, colour, style and movement of Pucci\u2019s clothing contributed an unsurpassed sophistication in casual dress, and it is still influential today. Known as the \"Prince of Prints\", Pucci designed slacks, shirts and dresses in vivid and startling colour combinations.  By urging chemical companies to develop a broader range of vibrant hues, Pucci created a kaleidoscope that had not been possible before.  He achieved varied effects, even within the same palette of colours, by changing the combination, scale and proportion.  His wild geometrics and multi-collared flowing designs replaced the staid, tame prints that had been more typical.  Pucci drew the hundreds of print designs for each collection himself, and he signed all of his creations with \"Emilio\", from clothing to carpets, from the Apollo 15 space mission logo to a Ford Lincoln Continental.  It was Pucci\u2019s combination of elegance and excitement that resulted in his tremendous success.  His designs were worn by countless celebrities, such as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Grace Kelly.","who_wears_it":["From Jennifer Lopez","Kristin Davis and Nicky Hilton to Isabella Rossellini and veteran model Veruschka."],"perfumes":["1965 Vivara (W)","1970 Signor Vivara","1971 Miss Zadig","1971 Monsieur Zadig","1980 Emilio Pucci (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Pucci"]}
{"designer_name":"Ermenegildo Zegna","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/ermenegildo-zegna\/"],"biography":"  Ermenegildo Zegna was just 20 years old when he took over his family's small wool-producing business in Trivero in 1910. This region had long been an important center for Italy's fabrics and wool industry. \n At the time, the men's luxury suit market was dominated by British wool makers and tailors. Zegna set out to emulate his English counterparts, adopting their production techniques. Nonetheless, Zegna maintained many of the traditional weaving techniques, such as using thistles to comb his wool. Zegna's quest for quality soon brought him to look beyond his own region, and by the 1930s, Zegna himself was traveling around the world in search of the finest wool herds. It was during this period that the company formed relationships with cashmere breeders in such far-flung places as Mongolia, South Africa, and Australia. \n   By the beginning of the 1960s, Zegna had won recognition for his high-quality and innovative fabrics. Zegna also had displayed an aptitude for wedding new technologies with traditional hand-crafting techniques. Zegna, who died in 1966 at the age of 74, turned over the leadership of the family business to his sons Angelo and Aldo in the 1960s. The new generation remained committed to their father's tradition of quality, yet became determined to establish the Zegna name beyond the fabrics production. While the company continued to act as a major supplier of high-quality fabric, in the 1960s Zegna began producing its own clothing. The company targeted the men's suit market. Rather than move into the mass consumer categories, Zegna instead became determined to capture a strong share of the rising Italian luxury men's suit sector. Into the 1970s, Zegna established its own men's collection. By the end of the decade, the company had begun producing a full range of clothing, including knitwear, accessories (including highly prized ties), and sportswear. Zegna also quickly recognized the potential for establishing an international presence to back up its growing export business. Another factory was opened in Spain in 1973, and another in Greece in 1975. The Greek plant closed after two years, however, because it was deemed unprofitable. A Zegna plant opened in Switzerland in 1977, which today employs 800 workers. While many Zegna suits are factory produced, the most expensive are still made-to-measure. Zegna opened its first retail store in Paris in 1980. Another store was opened in Milan in 1985. By the year 2000, there were 300 Zegna retail locations worldwide. Currently, the Zegna Group has boutiques in Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, Turkey, Mexico, the United States and Japan. More recently, stores have also opened in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia and India. The new generation of the Zegna family, including Aldo and Angelo's nine children, were by then assuming positions of greater importance within the family business. Taking the lead were cousins Ermenegildo, known as Gildo to differentiate him from his grandfather, and Paolo. With business school backgrounds, the cousins now set out to boost production and control costs. Among other initiatives, the company sought to drastically reduce its production lead times. the label Ermenegildo Zegna SpA is the world's leading luxury men's suit maker. Based in the mountain village of Trivero, Italy, near the Swiss border, Zegna is a vertically integrated business, producing more than two million meters of fabric, more than 350,000 finished suits, and another two million shirts, ties, sportswear, and accessories per year. Zegna develops its own fabrics from the world's finest wools--although the company does not itself own sheep herds, it works closely with breeders and farmers in Australia, South Africa, and Mongolia to ensure its supply of top-grade cashmere, mohair, and merino wool. This commitment to top quality enables the company to produce fabrics from threads as fine as just 11 microns. Eschewing the \"mass market\" approach of rival Armani, which does not produce its own suits, Zegna has developed an exclusive clientele throughout the world. More than 85 percent of the company's sales is achieved outside of Italy, primarily through the company's own store network. Zegna is present in more than 380 shops throughout the world, of which 135 are full-scale retail stores owned by the company, while the others operate as boutiques within department stores. Europe is the company's largest market, at 38 percent of sales, followed by North America, at 33 percent of sales. The company also has a strong presence in the Australasia region, which accounts for 25 percent of its sales and includes China, one of the group's fastest-growing markets. Zegna also has launched an extremely exclusive line of \"vintage\" clothing, made from the year's finest wool, for which the client chooses his own colors and styles. Ermenegildo Zegna, named for its founder, remains wholly controlled by his family, now represented by its fourth generation, cousins and co-CEOs Ermenegildo and Paolo Zegna. Other members of the Zegna family play active roles in the company. Zegna turned toward boosting its U.S. presence at the end of the 1980s. The company established a dedicated subsidiary there, Ermenegildo Zegna Corp., and began scouting for a suitable location, targeting New York City initially. The company succeeded in finding a site, on that city's Fifth Avenue, opening its first U.S. store in 1990. Zegna also had begun producing designer-labeled clothing for other designers. As part of this effort, the company formed a number of partnerships, including those with Romeo Gigli and also Spanish designer Antonio Miro. In 1990 the company formed a joint venture with Versace to produce and distribute a new line of V2 men's sportswear. The company continued to roll out new stores, including stores in Mexico City, Istanbul, Tokyo, and elsewhere. By the end of 1990, the company already operated 16 stores, in addition to a network of more than 150 in-store boutiques. The following year, the company opened its first store in China, in Beijing. Russia, and particularly Moscow and St. Petersburg, became company targets as well. Zegna by then already claimed a 30 percent share of the world's luxury men's suit market, with sales of more than $350 million per year. In the mid-1990s, the company opened a number of company-owned stores in Lisbon, Vienna, Shanghai, and Barcelona, while also adding franchise stores in Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and elsewhere. In its push to expand its customer base, Zegna also began designing new clothing lines to attract a younger clientele. In 1992, for example, the company introduced two new lines, Zegna Soft and Zegna Sportswear, which offered more casual clothing styles. The company also introduced its own cologne in 1993. In Japan, in 1997, Zegna launched a new, Japan-only line, E.Z. That brand was also the company's first to be produced outside of Europe and under contract. Then, in 1998, the company introduced a new brand and retail format, Zegna Sport. Acquisitions also marked the company's development at the dawn of the 21st century. In 1999, Zegna acquired Lanerie Agnona SpA, a maker of luxury women's wear. That purchase was followed by the acquisition of a controlling stake in Prato, Italy-based Master Loom, a maker of fabrics, in 2001. In 2002, Zegna bought most of Guida, another Italian company, which owned the Longhi brand of leather goods. That year, also, the company continued to extend its range of clothing and accessories with the formation of a joint venture company with Italian footwear group Ferragamo. The new company, called ZeFer, placed the Zegna brand on a line of footwear and leather accessories. Zegna meanwhile continued to build its own branded business. In the 2000s, the company launched a new brand concept, called Napoli Couture. The new suits featured the company's exclusive fabric, Vellus Aurem Trophy. The 2003 \"vintage\" produced just 75 kilos--enough for only 500 suits, at a price of some $7,500 each. At the other end of the spectrum, the company stepped up its efforts to attract a younger, more modern clientele. In October 2003, the company unveiled a new brand, Z.Zegna, with a full-scale rollout slated for the Fall 2004 collection. With more than EUR 680 million in sales in 2003, Zegna remained firmly at the top of the world's luxury menswear market.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Ermenegildo Zegna","Zegna Sport","Zzegna"]}
{"designer_name":"Elsa Schiaparelli","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/elsa-schiaparelli\/"],"biography":"  Elsa Schiaparelli was the leading Parisian fashion designer of the 1920s and 30s after Coco Chanel. \n Elsa Schiaparelli was born in Rome on September 10, 1890, of Italian and Egyptian heritage. She was great-niece of Giovanni Schiaparelli, who discovered the canals of Mars. She had a colourful childhood, although she did many things to shock her parents. She caused a sensation when she attended a ball in Paris with material just wound around her body, when it started to unravel. \n   When only 18, she married William de Wendt de Kerlor, a theosophist. She remained with him as he drifted around Europe, eventually reaching America, but he abandoned her when her daughter was born. She then returned to Paris, a young woman with a child to support. She tried to get a job with POIRET and Maggy ROUFF, unsuccessfully. However in 1928, she had some luck. She had drawn a design of a black sweater with a white trompe l'oeil bow at the neck. MAINBOCHER admired it and had it shown in the French VOGUE. Anita Loos purchased on, and a buyer for a New York store ordered 40 with skirts to go along with them. Elsa was surprised at the success of her sweater and recruited a group of Armenian women to knit them. She bought some good cheap material for the skirts, and rounded up another group of women to make these. \"Schiap\" was in business. She rented a studio at 4 rue de la Paix and put up her notice board \"pour le sport\". She started making clothes for Golf, tennis, skiing and swimming. Her designs started appearing in VOGUE. By 1929, she was selling all sorts of reversible, practical and convenient clothes. In 1930, she took over the downstairs studio and added \"day wear and evening wear\" to her notice board. The first of the Schiaparelli prints appeared. She experimented with costume jewellery. The early 30's saw Schiaparelli consolidated techniques, bringing together expert craftsmen for couture. A skilled atelier meant a finished garment and excellent construction following her genius as a designer. She sniffed out unusual materials like glass-like cellophane giving an illusion of transparency. Schiaparelli became famous for her black knit sweaters with a white bowtie pattern. She had a flair for the unusual and even hired Salvador Dal\u00ed to design fabric, producing a white dress with a lobster print. Schiaparelli was the first to use shoulder pads, hot pink, calling it shocking pink, in 1947, animal print fabrics, and zippers dyed the same colors as the fabrics. She is also well known for her surrealist designs of the 1930's, especially her hats, including one resembling a giant shoe and one a giant lamb chop, both which were famously worn by the Franco-American Singer sewing machine heiress Daisy Fellowes, who was one of Schiaparelli's best clients and who owned a pink gemstone that inspired the color shocking pink. She collaborated with many surrealist artists, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Jean Cocteau, and Alberto Giacometti, between 1936 and 1939. In 1934 Elsa Schiaparelli opened a shop in London and also moved her Paris salon to 21 place Vendome. In the window of her boutique she put Dali's handiwork along with other surrealist works, and it was a great attraction to people on their way to the Ritz Hotel nearby. In 1936 she introduced her Egyptian look with pagoda sleeves. In the same year the zipper was invented. Schiaparelli used it imaginatively in contrasting colours to her gowns. She used zippers in exposed places as decorations rather than hiding them away as fastenings. Furthermore in 1936 she also produced her 'DESK SUIT\" inspired by Dali, with some false pockets, some real, being a subdued variations on a theme. Her shocking clothes seldom offended any of her clients. Mrs Reginald Fellowes, Wallis Simpson later Duchess of Windsor, Millicent Rogers and Lady Elsie Mendl were among her elegant clients. It was even said that Daisy Fellowes managed to carry the lamp chop hat off. She dressed many movie stars both on and off the screen, including Marlene Dietrich, Gloria Swanson and Tallulah Bankhead. Her frenzy with Mae West, led to the actress's hour-glass figure being used for Schiap's perfume bottle for \"Shocking\". Another remarkable gown that year was the remarkable Dali lobster dress on an organdie field with parsley sprigs. Yet another was the musical notation dress. Dali also designed the textiles for the tear illusion dress of 1937 looking as if it had been torn repeatedly. 1937 also saw the back-to-front suit, with it's paradox of coming or going, which was copied by Karl Lagerfield in 1986. Another coat this year had cleverly embroidered profiles of faces by Jean Cocteau to form the illusion of a vase of roses. It was embroidered at the famous embroidery house of Lesage. Another Cocteau jacket bore his signature giving illusion of which part of the body was where. Her hats continued to be fascinating; one with a hen in a nest was on the cover of VOGUE in 1938. Schiaparelli loved colour, and had a way with unusual tints. They could be subtle or sharp or used in eccentric combinations. Turquoise linen with grape velvet piping, purple and olive green combined with dark red. A simple black dress became dramatic with lime green coat or fire engine red stockings. Most famous was her \"shocking pink\" a bright magenta, not a new shade but a new name for this shocking colour. When she died, she was buried wearing an antique Chinese robe of purest shocking pink. There were 3 great fantasy collections in 1938, the pink and blue children's world of the CIRCUS collection, the lush natural insect life of the PAGAN collection and the frolic (which became the name of Schiaparelli's lipstick) of the HARLEQUIN collection. During the 2nd World War, Schiaparelli's house closed and it re-opened in 1945. She offered examples of artistic clothing, but never with the inspired madness and exuberance of the 30's. Then she had combined art with couture, artisans and dressmakers in her atelier, until the creations became as one. Her output slowed by World War II and the title of trendsetters going to younger designers such as Christian Dior, her couture house declared bankruptcy in 1954 and she moved to the USA. She was briefly married to Count William de Wendt de Kerlor, once described as \"a persuasive but inconstant Theosophist,\" and moved with him to Greenwich Village in New York City. They had one daughter, Marisa, known as Gogo, who was born in New York City in 1919. Schiaparelli's grandchildren are the actress Marisa Berenson and the late photographer Berry Berenson (Mrs. Anthony Perkins). In 1951 Schiaparelli discontinued the couture part of her business, she limited her designs to accessories and in the 70's she made wigs. She herself retired from active work in 1954 and in the same year wrote her autobiography entitled \"My Shocking Life\". She died in 1973 at the age of 83. However her house was re-opened in 1977 by a designer team. Her lingerie and perfumes also still continue to be sold. In September 2003 an exhibition called \"Shocking Attire\" opened at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, on the 30th Annivery of Schiaparelli's death. It went on to Paris in January 2004. The exhibition and the book of the same name, set out to emphgasize the modernist roots of the designer known for her collaboration with Salvador Dali and the surrealists. This exhibition shows how much inspiration \"Schiap's\" work has been for all the modern designers.","the_look":"The 30's were \"Schiap's\" decade. Whatever she made, made headlines. Her buttons were justly famous, including bullets, cupids, clowns, rabbit's hooves, drums and astrological symbols. Her buttons and fastenings were insects, butterflies, fruit, vegetables, anything that did not look like a button. If she used a plain round button, she used diminishing sizes. \nHer hats were sensational, inkpots, shoes, her famous lamb chop hat. Many of these designs owe their inspiration from Surrealism which was the rage throughout the 30's. Schiaparelli's close contact with Salvador Dali led to a great many surrealistic designs in her clothes, as well as a range of accessories many of which were a statement rather than intended to be worn on the street. \nThroughout the 30's Schiaparelli gathered an affluent, adventurous clientele that bought with a recklessness almost as free as the designers's imagination. In that decade, Pareis was the site of the great Surrealist balls, which in their mixture of masquerade and elegance, provided the perfect context for Schiaparelli's innovations and illusions. Schiap, a Roman women with huge dark eyes and a taste for the tasteless, succeeded in teasing and amusing the public.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1934 Salut","1934 Souci","1934 Schiap","1937 Shocking","1938 Sleeping","1939 Snuff (M)","1946 Roi Soleil (bottle design Dali)","1948 Zut","Launch dates not known Souels","Eau de Sante","Verveine","Success","Fou","Sport","Si","S","So sweet","1976 Shocking you","1987 Arrogance","1992 Dance Arrogance","1998 Shocking Schiaparelli","1999 Exciting Arrogance","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}

After graduating in 1938, she began sketching dresses for department store newspaper advertisements. She married Judge Irving L. Levey in 1947. \n Ms. Wilkens's sensibility ran toward the unconstricted; even her party dresses were made of washable cottons. With developing adolescent figures in mind, her dresses featured adjustable waistlines; her full skirts allowed for widening hips. \n Ms. Wilkens came to the world of children's wear rather by accident. While vacationing in Hollywood in the early 1940's, Ms. Wilkens, then an illustrator, was erroneously introduced at a party as a children's fashion designer. Soon after, she was asked to design a wardrobe for Ann Todd, a child star, who needed to be outfitted for a new movie. As a result, Ms. Wilkens began designing clothes for the progeny of celebrities like Jack Benny and Gracie Allen. \n   In 1944, Emily Wilkens was given the prestigious Coty Fashion Award for American designers. She was described in the programme notes as a young American designer of taste and originality, who recognized an age group which deserved style consideration - and gave it to them. This age group was the teen-age girl described by Emily Wilkens long before the 1950's invented the rock-and-roll teenager. By 1948, Ms. Wilkens had started a concomitant career as a writer with the book ''Here's Looking at You: The Modern Slant on Smartness for the Junior Miss.'' She wrote four more books on beauty and grooming and served as a trustee of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York from 1966 to 1976. After receiving a diagnosis of dementia nine years ago, Ms. Wilkens was moved to the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale in 1991, where she died. She is survived by a daughter, Jane Wilkens Michael, a son, Hugh Levey, and five grandchildren. Many of her dresses were included in the exhibition held by the Costume Institute of New York's Metropolitan Museum called \"American Ingenuity - Sportswear 1930-1970\" held in 1998. The curator Richard Martin mentioned at the time of the Exhibition, that all the women designers whose dresses were being shown, had died, with the exception of Emily Wilkens. Unfortunately in 1998, she was too old and frail at the age of 78, to be able to attend the Exhibition and see the dresses she had made so long ago.","the_look":"Wilkens employed the principles of sportswear, testing every garment for practicality, emphasizing cottons and other easy-care fabrics and allowed a sweet young femininity to show in her garments. \nHer main ambition was to prove to the fashion world that wardrobes must be planned for young girls with the same care and perfection as garments for matrons. \nDesigner sportswear for younger girls was perfected by Emily Wilkens and she built in specific features for their benefit. Adjustable waistbands allowed for various sizes and weights, subtle swelling at the bust was a kind of perfect mean for the All-American girl, to accommodate a growing bust. \nWilkens was also known for showing black dresses with bright accessories, allowing girls to wear \"grown-up\" black without the austerity of mature dresses. \nShe observed young women at leasure and offered them playclothes similar to those being invented at the same time by other designers for their elders. \nMany of her dresses could have served as costumes for the musical \"Oklahoma\" popular in the 1940's.

{"designer_name":"Edward Molyneux","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/edward-molyneux\/"],"biography":"Edward Molyneux was a British fashion designer whose fashion house was in operation from 1919 until 1950. \n Edward Molyneux was an Irishman of Huguenot ancestry. He never exaggerated, always maintained sight of the elegant heights to which couture could soar. \n He was the designer to whom a fashionable woman would turn in the 20's and 30's when she wanted to be absolutely \"right\" and not predictable. He mixed with the aristocracy as well as caf\u00e9 society of between-the-wars Paris and gained insight into the needs of women in that era of change and freedom. He had the surest of hands, dressed Gertude Lawrence for the stage and Princess Marina of Greece for her wedding to the Duke of Kent. \n   Molyneux was born in London in 1891 and his first ambition was to be a painter. His sketch for an evening dress won a contest sponsored by Lucile (Lady Duff Gordon) who hired him but this was interrupted by the war when he was wounded and lost an eye. In 1918 he opened his salon in Paris and from the beginning, his style was extreme simplicity and perfect taste. Success came quickly and he moved into a larger maison and opened several branches. In addition to couture, he designed furs, lingerie, hats and perfume notably his \"Numero Cinq\". He dressed the most elegant women right up to the outbreak of World War II and escaped from Paris to London in 1940. Molyneux was known for conservative clothes but never staid or matronly. His typical customer was tall, thin and intelligent, with long slim legs and usually in the late twenties or thirties. His streamlined backless white satin evening dress with silver-fox furs thrown over the shoulder, became the symbol of 30's elegance. He was best known for his wonderful handling of navy blue and black, whether an easy plated skirt-suit or a slip-like evening dress. In The 30's the pure Molyneux look fully emerged. His soft velvet evening coats fell to the floor in a single unbroken line, his dresses with matching three-quarter length coats had a graceful fluidity. By the end of the 30's he experimented with a newly narrowed waist, one that later Dior called the \"New Look\". In the 30's Irish designer John Cavanagh worked under Molyneux in Paris, and gained valuable experience which stood him in good stead when he later opened his own house. After the war, Molyneux returned to Paris but it was not the same, his health particularly his eyesight, began to fail, so in 1950 he closed his Paris and London establishments and retired to Jamaica. In 1965, when the designer came out retirement, Time magazine described him as \"the Parisian equivalent of Manhattan's Mainbocher, a classicist devoted to the soft look and tailored line.\" He traveled widely and resumed his painting and in 1965 collaborated with his nephew with a ready-to-wear operation called \"Studio Molyneux\" He died in 1974 at the age of 83. He will be remembered for his streamlined 30's designs, clothing from a decade he helped to shape. Molyneux married, in 1923, as her first husband, (Jessie) Muriel Dunsmuir (1890-1951), one of the eight daughters of the Hon. James Dunsmuir, Premier of British Columbia. They divorced in 1924. Molyneux served as an infantry captain with the British army during World War II, during which time he lost an eye in battle.","the_look":"Captain Edward Molyneux embodied the style he created in the 1920s and 1930s\u2014an idle, slim (\"never too rich or too thin\"), elegant style on the verge of dissipation, at the edge of the outrageous, and always refined. \nMolyneux's ineffable decorum had come as a privilege of his own style liberation from Lucile, Lady Duff Gordon. Lucile's trademark was her rich proliferation of fine details and adornment. One would not characterize Lucile as florid, but one would certainly characterize Molyneux as chaste. His military self-presentation and English background did, however, make him seem even more Spartan in the world of French couture. Molyneux banned all superfluous decoration in an early and intuited version of modernist international style akin to the architecture of the period. He was a \"modern' in his adoration of line, avoidance of excessive decoration, as well as in his engaging manner; he was undeniably modern in his love of luxurious materials and his embrace of modern circumstances, including the automobile.\nWhile his work was most often in black, navy blue, beige, and grey, he had the sophistication as an art collector to collect late Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings, shown in 1952 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., sold to Ailsa Mellon Bruce, and later bequeathed to the National Gallery. Unfortunately, in early 2000s the origin of many of Molyneux's paintings came into question, after it became known that his principal dealer had collaborated with the Nazis. While it was not discovered how much if any of the collection had been stolen, Molyneux was not named as a knowing member of any scheme.\nMolyneux loved bourgeois scenes of beauty, but he also created motoring outfits and easy-to-wear slip-like evening dresses for the leisure class of his time and superbly cut evening pajamas that could have costumed any Noel Coward comedy. Molyneux would be a designer successful at designing for and determining the lifestyle of his own social class, participant-observer in what Pierre Balmain called Molyneux's international set. His curious Franco-English snobbism belonged to a time and place; his two post-World War II business enterprises were of limited success, so fully was he the product and model of a world already forgotten.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1975 Captain (M)","1977 Quartz (W)","1995 Quartz (M)","1995 Le Chic","1998 I Love You","2000 Modern Quartz (W)","2001 Modern Quartz (M)","(Launch dates unknown)","Gauloise (W)","Vivare","Fete","Lord","Numero Cinq (No 5)","Initiation (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Emmanuelle Khanh","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/emmanuelle-khanh\/"],"biography":"Emmanuelle Khanh was born in Paris in 1937. She worked as a model for BALENCIAGA in the mid 50's and later for GIVENCHY. \n In 1959 she realized that haute couture was appealing only to a small portion of a larger potential audience. She believed the time was right for rebellion against the strictures of haute couture, and she was not alone in this thinking\u2014during this time, Daniel Hechter created a style between comfort and sportswear, Cacharel redesigned its shirts, Michele Rosier began to create a cosmic line of windbreakers and anoraks, Chantal Thomass created her minidresses, Elie and Jacqueline Jacobson created Doroth\u00e9e Bis, and Sonia Rykiel launched her knitwear line. \n Khanh began to make attractive clothing for the masses. Her individuality quickly caught on in France, where she modeled and sold the clothes herself. In 1960 the magazine IT carried an article about Khanh and her work and her modern fashions soon reached the U.S. and were in demand in major department stores. The clothes Khanh had been making for herself, with the help of her husband, Quasar Khanh, were then noticed by Elle magazine. This exposure led to Khanh's collaboration with another ex-Balenciaga model, Christiane Bailly, to design their own groundbreaking Emmachristie collection in 1962. \n   Then she joined Dorothee Bis for a brief period and also worked for CACHAREL from 1962 to 1967. In 1970, Khanh established her own business. She continued to work freelance while pursuing her own lines, designing for Missoni, Krizia and Max Mara. In 1972 she created her ready-to-wear label. Her house continues and is at present owned by the France Luxury Group, which owns Jean-Louis Scherrer and Jacques Fath. In 1982 Khanh released a line of clothing under her own name and, in 1987, created Emmanuelle Khanh International. Some 150 boutiques around the world attest to her lasting popularity.","the_look":"She became famous for her long droopy collars on jackets, dresses and blouses, highly cut armholes, low-slung skirts; tiny round collars on blouses; short frilly skirts; linen outfits with lace trimming and embroidered blouses. \nHer name is associated with the Yeye fashions of the 60's. \nWhile Mary Quant was revolutionizing fashion in England at the beginning of the 1960s, Emmanuelle Khanh was at the vanguard of the young French ready-to-wear movement. From the French pronunciation of the Beatles' \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" the emerging clothes were known as y\u00e9 y\u00e9 fashion.\nKhanh criticized haute couture for hiding the beauty of the body. For her own designs, she emphasized femininity by cutting clothes along the body's curves, to follow the movement of the body, unlike Balenciaga's gowns, which could practically stand alone regardless of the woman's body within them. Khanh created an architecturally classic mode with a twist: careful seaming, narrow armholes, a slim, close to the body \"droop\" silhouette. Her suits had the surprise element of skirts that were actually culottes. Innovations included dog-eared collars, long fitted jackets with droopy collars, and blouses and dresses with collars consisting of overlapping petal-like shapes along a U-shaped opening.\nKhanh also had a democratic approach to fabric. She used denim and tie-dyeing, chenille, and plastic. A characteristic evening top in 1965 was made of cr\u00e9pe appliqu\u00e9d with fluorescent plastic circles. Khanh often used Shetland wools and Harris tweeds long favored by middle-class French women.\nKeeping pace with the ethnic trend of the 1970s, Khanh created short, loose, peasant-style dresses out of colorful Italian gauze fabrics. Feminine blouses were be trimmed with scalloped embroidered edges, short skirts were frilled, and lace was used to trim soft linen in her designs of the period. \nLater in the 1970s Khanh turned to designing knitwear and skiwear. A casual summer look consisted of a wide, striped cotton skirt, buttoned down the front, worn with a matching halter top and wedge-heeled shoes of matching fabric. The matching shoes were a couture touch for ready-to-wear.\nDuring the next decade, Khanh continued to freelance, making soft, individualistic fashions, bouncing creative ideas off her engineer, inventor, and interior-designer husband. Her signature line of boldly-rimmed glasses (\u00e1 la Drew Carey) is one such example. \nKhanh is well known for her original eyewear designs and especially in her innovative use of genuine lizard, snake, ostrich, crocodile, and shark skin on the frames of her handmade \"EK\"-initialed glasses. Khanh's clear plastic umbrellas have also been successfully marketed around the world.\nIn the 1980s, her clothes had a retro feeling about them, with extended shoulders and cinched waistlines that flattered the figure. One outfit featured a very long, very loose camel hair coat falling freely from the shoulders, caught about the waist by a narrow leather belt, worn over a soft, dark brown, wool jersey jumpsuit. \nKhanh continued to be active in the 1990s. For Jet Lag Showroom in 1990, she designed a suit consisting of a waist-length, tightly fitting jacket, worn with a long, full flannel skirt. She continued throughout the decade to create comfortable simple jackets and coats for special orders from the firm. Indisputably, this successful woman was one of the pioneers of ready-to-wear fashion of the 1960s and hopefully will continue to amaze the fashion world in the future.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/emmanuellekhanh","brands":["Emanuelle Khanh"]}

{"designer_name":"Edith Head","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/edith-head\/"],"biography":"Edith Head was an American costume designer who had a long career in Hollywood that garnered her more Academy Awards than any other woman in history. \n She was born Edith Claire Posener in San Bernardino, California, the daughter of Max Posener and Anna E. Levy. Whether her parents were married is unknown but, in 1901, her mother married Frank Spare and Edith was passed off as his child. Though her birth parents were Jewish, Head would claim to be a Catholic later in life. \n She graduated from Stanford University and the University of California and then continued her studies at the Otis Institute and Chouinard Art School in Los Angeles. \n   She than became a school teacher in La Jolla, California. On July 25, 1923, she married Charles Head, whom she divorced in 1936. In 1923, she worked for Howard Greer at Paramount Pictures in Hollywood. After this she worked as TRAVIS BANTON'S assistant in 1927 and was made head designer of the studio in 1938, a position she held until 1967. In all her career spanned 44 years at Paramount. She married set designer Wiard Ihnen, on September 8, 1940. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1968. In 1954, she provided Grace Kelly with a silk gown which was the height of elegance, when she attended the Oscar ceremony to receive her Academy Award for the Country Girl. At that time, the dress was the most expensive in Oscar history. In the late 60's she moved over to Universal Films. During her time at Paramount, she also designed for films made by MGM, Columbia, 20th Century Fox and Warner Brothers. In all she has designed clothes for more that 1,000 films. Mae West, Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor and Grace Kelly are among the actresses for whom she designed. In 1936, Head's sarong for Dorothy Lamour in \"Jungle Princess\" was widely copied. In 1951, she created a strapless evening dress with a fitted bodice covered with white violets and a skirt made of white tulle over green satin for Elizabeth Taylor to wear in \"A place in the Sun\". This dress was copied throughout the USA. Edith Head helped to popularize South American clothes, in particular the Spanish camisa (shirt) rebozo (scarf) and the Poncho. She has involved herself in many activities, lecturing extensively on dress, writing two books \"The Dress Doctor\" and \"How to dress for Success\", and being fashion editor of \"Holiday\" magazine. Ms. Head was known for her no-nonsense, assertive working style. Despite her own accomplishments, she also had a reputation for taking credit for others' work \u2014 but in the studio days a department head not uncommonly claimed credit for everything in her department. Privately, she was a warm and loving hostess, hosting fabulous soirees at her and her husband's Benedict Canyon home. Her last film project was the black and white comedy Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, starring Steve Martin and Carl Reiner, in which she accurately re-created fashions of the 1940s, matching the extensive use of film clips from classic film noir motion pictures. It was released shortly after her death and dedicated to her memory. During her long career she was nominated for 34 Academy Awards, including every year from 1948 through 1966, and won eight times, more Oscars than any other woman has won. She was responsible for some of the best-known Hollywood fashion images of her day, with her costumes being worn by the most glamorous and famous actresses in films seen by millions. Head's influence on world fashion was far reaching, especially in the 1950s when she began appearing on Art Linkletter's television program and writing books on fashion. She died in October 24,1981 from a rare bone marrow disease at the age of 83 (four days before her 84th birthday) and was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6504 Hollywood Blvd.","the_look":"Head had no formal training in design and she took care to work within what she saw as her limitations. She might never be considered a couturier, but she could\u2014and did\u2014become a taste-maker. Thus while contemporaries Ert\u00e9 and Adrian came to be known for gowns which epitomized fantasy and glamor, Edith Head made herself known for designing beautiful and flattering clothes which the movie-going public could easily imagine wearing.\nOne of the most challenging problems for any theatrical designer is so-called \"modern dress.\" A motion picture may be shot up to two years before it is shown to the public but clothing must not betray this fact by seeming dated. If so versatile a designer may be said to have a trademark, Head's would be a clean and simple line with a minimum of detail, in a subdued palette. Head produced timeless classics which never competed with the performer and never took focus from the storyline. It was all, she said, \"a matter of camouflage and magic.\"","who_wears_it":["Mae West","Frances Farmer","Paulette Goddard","Veronica Lake","Barbara Stanwyck","Ginger Rogers","Ingrid Bergman","Dorothy Lamour","Betty Hutton","Loretta Young","Olivia de Havilland","Hedy Lamarr","Angela Lansbury","Bette Davis","Anne Baxter","Gloria Swanson","Elizabeth Taylor","Audrey Hepburn","Ann Robinson","Grace Kelly","Doris Day","Anne Baxter","Marlene Dietrich","Rita Hayworth","Kim Novak","Patricia Neal","Tippi Hedren","Claude Jade"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Esterel Jacques","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/esterel-jacques\/"],"biography":"Couturier Jacques Esterel liked to refer to himself as a \"Parisian craftsman of dresses and songs.\" And in fact he was an entertainer as well as a designer, writing several plays and songs for the guitar in addition to running his many boutiques in France and throughout Europe. He brought his theatrical side into his clothing design, creating amusing novelties and employing outrageous styles and props, so much so that many of his admirers and critics considered him more of a showman than a serious couturier. \n Esterel, whose real name was Charles Martin, was the son of a French industrialist and was originally educated as an engineer. He established his couture house, Jacques Esterel, in 1953. The first years were especially successful as Esterel contributed to a playful fashion spirit, illustrated by the \"Vichy\" bridal gown which he designed for French actress Brigitte Bardot. Esterel built up an international reputation for his couture house, traveling the world to promote his collections, even appearing behind the Iron Curtain when the Soviet Union was off-limits to Westerners. But Esterel always remained true to his love of the stage and his background as an engineer, claiming that the 72 patents he held on machine tools allowed him to support his fashion design career. \n There was something of the carnival performer in Esterel's attitude toward fashion. His designs were often extremely fanciful\u2014and often ridiculed by the fashion press. It was as if couture for Esterel was more about exploring his own sense of whimsical creativity rather than about designing clothes. In 1963 his show included tweed hats with small black veils and umbrellas with built-in lights. Prior to the 1964 show he declared that several of his top models would appear with shaved heads \"to give a new importance to a woman's face.\" His 1965 collection was called \"confused and complicated,\" and included striped bathing suits with long skintight legs described as looking like \"something out of a Mack Sennett movie.\" \n   Esterel was not simply a jester at the court of fashion, however, he was often in the forefront of fashion trends in the 1960s and 1970s, taking au courant looks from stylish young \"Mods and Rockers\" on the streets and translating them into haute couture. His 1965 designs for men included a plaid suit with a kilt and a salmon-colored Nehru jacket in corduroy, worn over high yoked pants with zippers on front and back. For women he created dramatic evening wear, including an ensemble of overblouse, floor-length skirt and great hooded evening cape of matching velour. Esterel's lively intelligence saw no creative boundaries, whether he was designing a garment, writing a song, making his own store fixtures, or sharing his vision with other designers. In the early 1970s Esterel created his most well-known and talked-about collection, the \"unisex\" line, presenting clothes designed for both men and women. Ever the iconoclast, his first foray into the U.S. found him opening a couture shop in the New York suburbs, far from the fashion industry center in New York City. And the high-spirited, uninhibited house of Esterel attracted and fostered young talents, including future stars Anne Marie Beretta and Jean-Paul Gaultier. Esterel's unfortunate and sudden death in 1974 did not signal the end of the house of Esterel. His widow and daughter strove to continue his spirit of fashion adventure, overseeing Creations Jacques Esterel. Throughout the 1980s the company was involved in several highly-publicized lawsuits in regard to trademark infringement against Yves Saint Laurent (for a design Esterel called the Petit Marquis and YSL called the Toreador) and also over the disputed purchase of the venerable house of Madame Alix Gr\u00e9s. The trademark suit, originally dismissed from criminal court, was refiled in civil court and resolved in favor of the Esterels in 1985. Yves Saint Laurent, roundly considered the most respected house in Paris haute couture, was fined $11,000 and required to pay a $1,100 fine for every suit made from the plagarized Petit Marquis design.

{"designer_name":"Elisa Jimenez","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/elisa-jimenez\/"],"biography":"Elisa Jimenez was born in El Paso, Texas, in 1965. She is the daughter of sculptor Luis Jim\u00e9nez and graphic designer Vicky Balcou. By the age of five, she was sewing doll clothes and fixing her own hems. \n She attended the University of Texas at El Paso where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a minor in anthropology. She went on to earn a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Arizona. \n She is an interdisciplinary artist, primarily in fashion design but also including writing, drawing, painting, performance art, and art installation. Her designs have been shown for years at the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York. \n   She started her \"Hunger World\" line of clothes in 1996. In the beginning, she made clothes only for herself and her friends, but when Vogue started to write about her, she found herself making for others and earning money. In 1999, she started selling clothes from a Soho boutique Kirna Zabete, where owner Sarah Hailes had to remind her to put labels on her garments. She signs them backwards, so that they can only be read in a mirror. Time magazine published a full page on her, in February, 2001. The Designer debut show at New York's Fall 2001 fashion week, showed Jiminez's designs. Fashion Wire Daily publication said \"Jiminez stole the show with her not-of-this-world clothes.\" Jimenez's wild sexy, slashy designs include tea-soaked dresses with exposed seams, tops with disconnected sleeves and thermal pants with burned hems. The garments seem to embody a revolutionary spirit taking over the catwalk. Her clothes are not for the faint of heart with her trademark exposed seams and jagged edges. In September 2001 Elsa was all ready to present her Fall 2002 collection, when the Terrorist attack took place in New York. Her arrangements were cancelled. However Vogue helped with the finances, and Carolina Herrara lent her 7th Avenue showroom, so Elsa Jimenez and 10 other young designers put on a show called \"An American Way\" to show their collections. She has worked for a number of actors, musicians, films and television programs, including: Melissa Auf der Maur, Cher for her Believe album, Jennifer Connelly for her character in Requiem for a Dream, Marisa Tomei, Courtney Love, Sarah Jessica Parker, Sex and the City, Pink, Cameron Diaz, and art photographer Cindy Sherman. Jimenez was invited to be in the Barbican Gallery's exhibit and book Rapture: Art and Fashion Since the 1970s, curated by Chris Townsend of London. In 2007 Jimenez was a contestant on the fourth season of Project Runway, a reality show on Bravo in which designers compete against each other in various fashion challenges to win $100,000 to create their own fashion line, among other prizes. Jimenez had been picked to appear on the first season of the show but opted out to avoid separating from her young daughter and because of a scheduling conflict. Jimenez was eliminated in the show's sixth episode. In a Project Runway testimonial, Jimenez disclosed that she was the victim of a motor-vehicle impact as a pedestrian. She was hit by a Porsche and cracked her skull open \"3, almost four inches\". She obviously made a significant recovery.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

She did well in science and math studies, and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1996 with a degree in Psychology. She considered becoming a doctor until deciding against it after a depressing month-long hospital stay due to an incident in which she broke her back while snow sledding on a golf course using a cafeteria tray. \n She enrolled at the Parsons School of Design part-time, and worked at Allure Magazine, from which she was fired after a year. She gave herself a regrettable haircut and then shaved it off. In order to conceal her head, she wore a feathery hat of her own design which received compliments around town from several people, among them Parker Posey. The owner of New York City boutique Bond 07 asked to see more of her hats, and this led to a deal to sell them. After Barneys New York ordered her hats, she decided to start her own business. \n   Kim opened her first retail store in the East Village of downtown New York in 1997. She collaborated with photographer David LaChapelle early in her career. She comes from a family of doctors who expected her to become one as well, and \"For the first six months, my parents absolutely didn't support me\", she recalled in an interview in Marie Claire.

{"designer_name":"Elio Fiorucci","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/elio-fiorucci\/"],"biography":"Elio Fiorucci was born in Milan, Italy in 1935. He inherited a shoe store from his father in 1962. In the mid-60's, he began traveling to London to bring mini-skirts and other fashionable items for sale in his shop in Milan. In 1967, he opened a larger store, selling clothes from London as well as those he designed himself, and he became world famous. \n In 1970 Elio selected the two-angel Logo which has become so well-known as the sign of Fiorucci. \n Fiorucci stores opened throughout the world, cleverly designed so that merchandising, packaging and display all reflected the company's image. Garments were fresh, new and amusing, like plastic rainboots in bright colours, T-shirts, platform shoes, fluorescent socks and scarves. Fiorucci captured the spirit of the moment for a mainly young market, recycling old ideas in new ways. \n   His tightly cut, streamlined jeans of the 70's named Buffalo 70 were also in great demand. Fiorucci is credited with the concept of designer denim. In 1975 he opened his first New York store. In 1977 at the opening of the famous nightclube Studio 54, Elio made the arrangements with artist Andy Warhol. Fiorucci refuses to design for women above size 10, claiming his clothes are only suitable for small women. In 1984 when the Graffiti fad hit, everyone worked overtime to transform his Milan store. In 1987 Fiorucci produced the Junior Gaultier line designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, and in 1989 they went back to their roots with a deal with Vivienne Westwood, queen of the London street scene. In the 90's, he has gone back to the 50's themes. One of his favourite words is \"recycle\". Today jeans are the centerpiece of the Fiorucci empire. They come in all colours, fushcia, peach and jade. He emphasizes the details of garments, multi-coloured buttons running down the front of a man's shirt, glimmer of metallic threads darting off the surface of a plaid cotton. His motto is \"fun and fashion\". In 1999 he hosted MTV at his offices who filmed him live as the king of the T-shirt. He is going into the 21st century, in just as lively a manner as he was in the 1960's. In March 2003, Elio Fiorucci announced that after 36 years, he is closing the doors to his historic shop in Corso Vittorio Emmanuele, Milan. When Fiorucci hit the scene nearly 40 years ago, he blew Italy - and the rest of the world - away with a larger-than-life attitude. He brought in the new and unexpected, pre-dating the surge of today's \"lifestyle\" stores. Fiorucci mixed clothing with beauty products vintage items, music and home furnishings. He even used his retail space for artistic performances. Elio says the reason he is closing is because he has \"fallen out of love\" with fashion at the age of nearly 70. In the early 2000\u2019s, Elio Fiorucci creates the Love Therapy brand, offering new garments, new jeans, new T-shirts, dresses and accessories designed to bring happiness and optimism. Coloured dwarfs are the symbol of Love Therapy. In 2004, Elio Fiorucci receives the \u201cPiazza Mercati\u201d award from the Milan Chamber of Commerce for his career as a fashion designer, talent scout, entrepreneur and communicator. Two years later, Ekio Fiorucci creates the Baby Angel line for Brand Zero, a collection of glamorous, yet affordable, clothes. In the same year, he receives the \u201cAmbrogino d\u2019Oro\u201d award for his leading role in Italian fashion and for having revolutionized the style of young generations, combining trends from all around the globe. The following year, in 2008, Elio Fiorucci signs a sole licence agreement to produce and distribute the woman\/girl Love Therapy brand via Brand Zero, a company controlled by Gruppo Coin S.p.A.

It was originally created in 1983 by the late Francisco Moschino, and is well known for its \"classico con twist\", classical twist. The current head of design, Rosella Jardini, has been trying recently to tone down the humorous attitude established during the time of Francisco Moschino.

He created a dinner suit with a knife and fork appliqu\u00e9d on the bodice, his blazers had windmills for buttons. His polka dot Minnie Mouse dresses were very popular. \nThe Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, held an exhibition called \"Fashion - Italian Style\" from February to April 2003.

He is also the winner of the Council of Fashion Designers America (CFDA) award for best womenswear designer in March 2006 as well as in June 2008. Costa's designs have sometimes estranged longtime Calvin Klein customers. His clothes are lighter and more feminine than those marketed by Calvin Klein previously. \n Costa is the second youngest of five children. He grew up in Guarani, Brazil, where his mother, Maria-Francisca, owned a children's wear factory. She began her business producing dresses commissioned by a traveling salesman. Costa's father, Jacy Neves da Costa, ran a small ranch. In his hometown of 4,000 people, Costa put on fashion shows for charities. His size is compact and he has brown eyes. Being civic minded by nature, his mother was like the mayor of the town. She presided over her family. Costa remembers there being fifteen people at his family's lunch table. \n   When his mother died in 1981 he left with a friend for New York City. He was twenty and spoke no English at the time. He enrolled in a language class at Hunter College and took courses at the Fashion Institute of Technology at night. He obtained employment with Herbert Rounick, whose Seventh Avenue (Manhattan) company made dresses for Oscar de la Renta and Bill Blass. Costa went to work for de la Renta after Rounick's death, designing for the firm's Japanese licenses. Costa credits de la Renta with teaching him the most about both designing clothes and life. He remained with the company for five years. Klein's partner, Barry Schwartz, brought Costa's name to Klein's attention in 2001. Costa became the principal designer for Calvin Klein at the age of 42, in September 2003. Earlier in the year Klein sold his company to Phillips-Van Heusen for approximately $730 million. Costa joined the Klein design group in 2001 after working for Gucci,  where he was an assistant to Tom Ford. Their first collaboration is known as the Cher Collection. Costa was mentioned as a possible replacement when Ford retired from designing for Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, in late 2003.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Calvin Klein","Calvin Klein 205W39Nyc","Calvin Klein Inc","Francisco Costa Cruz"]}

{"designer_name":"Fernando Botero","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/fernando-botero\/"],"biography":"Fernando Botero was born in Medellin, Colombia in 1932. \n After attending Jesuit school in Medellin, he went to a school for Matadors from 1944 to 1946. He first exhibited in 1948 in Medellin with other artists from the region. \n His professional career started with illustrations for the Sunday supplement of the Daily paper El Colombiano. \n   From 1949 to 1950 he went to the San Jose school in Marinilla, near Medellin and then working as a set designer moved to Bogota in 1951. He had his first one-man exhibition there at the Galeria Leo Matiz. From 1952 to 1953 he studied at the Academia de San Fernando in Madrid, Spain, and in 1953 moved to Paris. He is married to Greek sculptor Sophia Vari. It is his second marriage. He has sons Fernando and Juan Carlos. An earlier son Pedro had been killed in a car accident at the age of 4. Botero studied fresco techniques and art history in Florence from 1953 to 1955 and this influenced his painting. He lived in New York from 1960 to 1970 and his primary inspiration was from the Italian Renaissance. He began experimenting with creating volume in his paintings and sculptures and compressing the space around them. His figures are always very bulky and massive. In September 1981, in French Vogue's own words \"Fernando Botero, the celebrated Colombian painter, was invited by the French edition to illustrate that autumn's collections.\" It seemed a very good idea to invite an artist of some real distinction and achievement in the wider creative world beyond fashion, couture and the mode, to concern himself for once, as much for his own enjoyment as for professional advancement or commercial ploy. French Vogue was prepared to take the plunge, at least now and again and in a magnificent sequence of 15 paintings and a dozen drawings, Botero proceeded to do so, and yet without compromising himself or modifying his work to the slightest degree. His obsessively, emphatically bulbous and wholly delightful ladies, who confound so spectacularly the conventional wisdom of our times that fat can never be beautiful, let alone most elegantly fashionable, show off the creations of the great Paris houses, the very highest of high fashion, as never before. Botero's extraordinary fashion plates are manifestly sympathetic and charming, witty and sometimes very funny besides; but chiefly they are demonstrably practical and effective. This is not to say that Senor Botero should for ever after earn his living in the salons and studios of Parisian Couture; but the simple fact is that, having been asked, he performed to exquisite effect. Botero is one of the richest and most successful artists. In June 2005 a major retrospective opened in Rome, of 170 of his paintings and sketches. The Exhibition moves to Germany and Greece later in the year.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

His discoverer, Alberto Nodiolini, believes that Berthoud's talent is to know how to translate phenomena like Expressionism into a modern perspective. He makes them comprehensible even to the very young who perhaps have never heard of them. He uses the unusual technique of wood-cutting for his illustrations. \"I like engraving fashion plates because it is terribly paradoxical, using such a hard instrument, giving weight to each gesture, to render something as light, as evanescent as an article of clothing\" he says. He has also created animated cartoons for Italian television and held exhibitions in France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Japan. His woodcuts have a savage sensual quality. Their somber atmosphere is charged with eroticism. He illustrates for many major fashion designers like Mondi, Missoni, Moschino, Krizia, Lacroix, Romeo Gigli, Prada, Vivienne Westwood and many others. The illustration on the right is from Jean-Paul Gaultier in 1987. In the 90's, he started illustrating for the quarterly New York-based fashion publication Visionnaire.

{"designer_name":"Florence Nightingale Graham","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/florence-nightingale-graham\/"],"biography":"Florence Nightingale Graham, who went by the business name Elizabeth Arden, was a Canadian businesswoman who built a cosmetics empire in the United States. \n Arden was born in Woodbridge, Ontario, Canada in 1966, where she lived until the age of 24. In 1909, Florence Nightingale Graham dropped out of nursing school in Toronto. \n She then joined her elder brother in New York City, working briefly as a bookkeeper for the E.R. Squibb Pharmaceuticals Company. While there, she spent hours in their lab, learning about skincare. She then worked - again briefly - for Eleanor Adair, an early beauty culturist, as a \"treatment girl\". \n   In 1909 Arden formed a partnership with Elizabeth Hubbard, another culturist. When the partnership dissolved, she coined the business name \"Elizabeth Arden\" from her former partner and from Tennyson's poem \"Enoch Arden\". In 1912 Arden travelled to France to learn beauty and facial massage techniques used in the Paris beauty salons. She returned with a collection of rouges and tinted powders she had created. In an era when it was generally only acceptable for entertainers to wear makeup, Arden introduced modern eye makeup to North America. She also introduced the concept of the \"makeover\" in her salons. In 1915 she married Thomas J. Lewis, a banker, thus becoming an American citizen. Arden's drive for success cost her marriage to Lewis. They divorced in 1934. A second marriage to a Russian prince only lasted 2 years. Arden collaborated with A. Fabian Swanson, a chemist, to create a \"fluffy\" face cream. The success of the cream, Venetian Cream Amoretta, and corresponding lotion, Arden Skin Tonic, led to a long-lasting business relationship. This revolutionized cosmetics, bringing a scientific approach to formulations. Other innovations included creating foundations that matched a person's skin tone; creating the idea of the \"Total Look\" in which lip, cheek, and fingernail colors matched or coordinated; and the first to make a cosmetics commercial shown in movie houses. During World War II, Arden recognized the changing needs of the American woman entering the work force. She showed women how to apply makeup and dress appropriately for careers outside the home. She created a lipstick called Montezuma Red, for the women in the armed forces that would match the red on their uniforms. Although most of her commercial success was in cosmetics, she also pioneered restorative musical exercises based on yoga. She started a fashion business in 1943 with notable designers like Charles James and Oscar de la Renta on staff. She began expanding her international operations in 1915, and started opening salons across the world. By the end of 1930s, it was said that \"There are only three American names that are known in every single corner of the globe: Singer sewing machines, Coca Cola, and Elizabeth Arden.\" A fact proved by Heinrich Harrer in his book Seven Years in Tibet, where he stated that it's possible to buy Arden's products\u2014even in Tibet. At the peak of her career, she had a salon in New York, Washington, Boston, Chicago, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Maine, Arizona, Phoenix, Southhampton, Surfside, Florida, Palm Beach, Philadelphia, Honolulu, Lima. Toronto, Montreal, Melbourne, Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Johannesburg, London, Paris, Zurich, Vienna, Milan, Rome, Cannes, Madrid, Brussels, Copenhagen, The Hague, London, Ontario, Cape Town, Nassau, Tulsa, Quebec City, and Biarritz. She launched all of them personally and she owned all of them except the one in Paris, which she gave to her sister, Gladys, Vicomtesse de Maublanc. From the 1930s through the 1960s, Elizabeth Arden was considered the most upscale cosmetic brand. The introduction of the perfume Blue Grass in 1934 was a great success. Considered the first all-American scent, it remains on the market today. Arden named her exclusive Long Pond resort and health spa Maine Chance which catered to her wealthy clientele. At one time the Mt. Vernon, Maine resort and its operating farm produced much of the food for the spa and was a significant employer in the town. In recognition of her contribution to the cosmetic industry, she was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by the French government in 1962. Arden died in New York City in 1966 and was interred in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York under the name Elizabeth N. Graham. At the time of her death, her estate was worth $30 to $40 million (US) and she had over a hundred salons worldwide. A feature-length documentary film The Powder and the Glory (2009) by Ann Carol Grossman and Arnie Reisman, details the rivalry between Arden and Helena Rubenstein. Arden used the name Maine Chance Farm for her Thoroughbred horse racing and breeding operation in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1931 she had bought her first horse at the Fasig-Tipton sales at the Saratoga Race Course. From 1944 on, she worked closely with Leslie Combs II who selected and purchased horses for her. However, according to a 1947 interview with the Thoroughbred Record, Combs said she had a good eye for horses herself and chose a number of successful runners on her own. In the nineteen forties and fifties Elizabeth Arden built her Maine Chance Farm stable into a major force in American Thoroughbred horse racing. In 1945, Star Pilot and Beaugay were the Eclipse Award colt and filly champions, and her stable was the leading money-winner in the United States. In 1947 her colt Jet Pilot, trained and ridden by future Hall of Famers Tom Smith and Eric Guerin won the Kentucky Derby. Putting her on the cover of the May 6, 1946 issue of Time magazine. In 1948, she also acquired the great filly Busher as a broodmare from a spectacular auction conducted by Louis B. Mayer. Busher was not only inducted into the Hall of Fame, she ranked #40 in Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. In 1954, her filly \"Fascinator,\" won the Kentucky Oaks. For her contribution to the racing industry, Elizabeth Arden Graham was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2003.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Queen Mary","Queen Elizabeth II","Elizabeth","Queen Mother","Marilyn Monroe","Jacqueline Kennedy","Marlene Dietrich","Joan Crawford","Wallis Simpson and Mamie Eisenhower"],"perfumes":["1934 Blue Grass (W)","1957 Sandalwood (M)","1987 Passion (W)","1989 Passion (M)","1989 Red Door (W)","1991 White Diamonds (W)","1993 Sunflowers (W)","1993 Diamonds & Emeralds (W)","1993 Diamonds & Rubies (W)","1993 Diamonds & Sapphires (W)","1994 True Love (W)","1996 Fifth Avenue (W)","1996 Black Pearls (W)","1998 Splendor (W)","1999 White Diamonds Sparkling (W)","1999 Green Tea (W)","2001 Green Tea Iced (W)","2001 Green Tea Spiced (W)","2001 White Diamonds Brilliant (W)","2002 Forever Elizabeth (W)","2002 Arden Beauty (W)","2002 Eau Fraiche (W)","2003 Red Door Revealed (W)","2003 Gardenia Elizabeth Taylor (W)","2004 Provocative (W)","2005 Green Tea Summer (W)","2005 Fifth Avenue after five (W)","2006 Provocative Interlude (W)","2006 Daytona 500 (M)","2006 Red Door Velvet (W)","2006 Green Tea Intense (W)","2006 Green Tea Revitalize (W)","2007 Mediterranean (W)","2007 Green Tea Tropical (W)","2008 Fifth Avenue Nights (W)","2008 Mediterranean Breeze (W)","2008 Red Door Shimmer (W)","2008 Green Tea Lotus (W)","2009 Pretty (W)","2009 Fifth Avenue Style (W)","2009 Green Tea Exotic (W)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}

His education partakes of both Oriental and Occidental cultures, he learns several languages and starts painting young. He then continues his formal studies in France and England where he obtains a degree in economics \n Back to Morocco at the age of 24, destined for a career of businessman, he decides however to devote himself to fashion. He works out a new dying process, finds local textile mills to manufacture an innovative fabric and designs his first collection, which is immediately bought by French industrials who sell it under their own label. \n   In 1980, he decides to settle in France. Pierre d\u2019ALBY asks him to be his artistic director, which he does for 5 years. Willing to express his own conception of fashion, he creates in 1986 the label PLEIN SUD that is immediately successful in France and overseas. Since the creation of his label, Fay\u00e7al AMOR most important concern has been the development of the company\u2019s structures integrating design, manufacture and marketing. Plein Sud now boasts 15 flagship stores, including ones on Paris' Place des Victoires, London's Walton Street and New York\u2019s Greene Street in Soho. The collection also retails in 400 multi-brand boutiques and department stores including Henri Bendel and Barneys. There's a lower-priced, funkier Plein Sud jeans collection, too. Faycal is so determined to keep quality control, in fact, that he insists on keeping apparel production within Plein Sud's fully-owned factories, and has steered clear of licenses. Name one other significant French brand that can say that (the answer is Chanel). Ironically, Amor publicly infringed his non-licensing rule last night, when he and old pal Joseph Ettegui, the founder of Joseph, hosted an opening party for the new Plein Sud store on London's Draycott Avenue. Joseph will manage the boutique, making their partnership a unique scenario, given Plein Sud's lack of licensing history. All Plein Sud skins are prepared in Italy, and most of Amor's leathers have stretch silk backings, giving them a glove-like quality around the body. Faycal loves playing with proportions, showing off stretch wool tops held on with asymmetrical hook and eye seams. The designer has also developed during the past years various lines complementing the main one PLEIN SUD. Following PLEIN SUD SOIR in 1994, he launches PLEIN SUD SUN in 1995, PLEIN SUD JEAN\u2019S and SHOES in 1997 and PLEIN SUD TRICOT in 1999.","the_look":"Always searching new harmonies, creating new fabrics, draping his own structures, Fay\u00e7al AMOR designs collections that perfectly translate his inspiration.","who_wears_it":["Cher","Britney Spears and Mary J.

She used to play the organ and piano at the St. Peter\u2019s Italian church. By the time she had also begun her career as a stylist in Molineaux Atelier, first of its kind in Europe. It is from here that she learned the art of dress making. She was so fond of that that she decided to make her career in the same favorite flair of hers. \n By the year 1930, she left London and came back to Italy. She soon got engaged as an art director together with well known Madame Anna, by Ventura. \n   In 1934 a branch of Ventura was opened in Roma and Fernanda was handed over the charge, again, along with Madame Anna to look after it. Her fame grew and grew. Everyone began to recognize the flair within her. When in Italy, she moved on into collaboration with Ventura Tailors located in Milan. She quickly moved up to become the creative director there. Gattinoni was by then sequentially transferred to a new location in Rome. It is here that she met Isa Miranda. The meeting brought about a lucky turn around where the actress wanted Fernanda to design the dresses for her entire cast in her film in 1939. The film was \u2018Hotel Imperial.\u2019 It was an instant hit and everybody approved of the costumes. This brought her her next success when she also designed the clothing for \u2018Adventure Diamonds,\u2019 in the subsequent year. By 1945 she wanted to open an atelier of her own. Since art was much related to cinema and theatre alike, many personalities from various fields came to her. They include personalities like Visconti Guttuso, Zeffirelli and many others.

The Persian Shah Sisters had their wedding dresses designed by the creative hands of the atelier. By 1960, Fernanda Gattinoni had created an Empire style collection that redefined her name in the entire world.

{"designer_name":"Francis Hendy","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/francis-hendy\/"],"biography":"Since learning the art of sewing at his mother's knee in Trinidad, Francis Hendy has been quietly building a fashion legacy. At the close of 2004, with a new collection being introduced, four distinct fashion lines, and plans for wholesaling and franchising his brand, Hendy was set to clothe Americans nationwide in his funky, colorful fashions. \n Francis Hendy was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, to a family of five siblings. His father Franklin was a contractor and builder and his mother Elizabeth was a seamstress, deeply involved in the Trinidad fashion scene. \n In 1972, at about the age of 21, Hendy decided to join an older sister in New York City and seriously pursue a design career. In New York he approached Trinidadian contacts and began designing custom clothes for them. He also began creating elaborate costumes for Brooklyn's annual Caribbean Day Parade. He sharpened his talents with an apprenticeship with a master tailor, and also took courses at the Parson's School of Design and the famed Fashion Institute of Technology. In 1986 Hendy set up a small storefront shop in the Flatbush district of Brooklyn. Francis Hendy Inc. provided ready-to-wear and custom pieces to a loyal clientele. \n   By 1996, Hendy was bringing in $80,000 per year at his tiny shop and he felt he had reached his limit. In 1998 he decided to move into Manhattan's famed garment district and he opened a showroom on West 39th Street. Instead he got MTV exposure, which proved a lot more valuable. Hendy became the designer of choice for rap and R&B artists. By 1999 Francis Hendy Inc, had annual sales of $400,000, fueled in large part by his musician clientele. Hendy entered the high-profile ready-to-wear market in the Spring of 1998 with the debut of his first men's sportswear collection during New York's famed Fashion Week. By 2000 he was getting quite a bit of notice, though his clothes still had rock star leanings. The review concluded on a positive calling his designs, \"refreshingly inspired.\" Fashion insiders agreed and Hendy was awarded the prestigious 2000 Michael Award for Menswear Designer of the Year. Hendy called receiving the award the proudest moment of his career. Over the next several years Francis Hendy, Inc. grew. A half-dozen full-time sewers joined the staff as well as all four of Hendy's siblings. As the company expanded, Hendy's designs became more sophisticated, less rock-and-roll. His Fall 2001 collection was inspired by his father, who died that year. That year his sales topped half a million. He was also short-listed for the Rising Star award from the Fashion Group International. Meanwhile, Hendy sharpened his design focus. In 2002 Hendy added a women's line to his offerings. In September of 2002 Hendy opened his first retail shop in the trendy Soho district of New York. He stocked the 1700-square-foot space with clothes from his Hendy Bridge line of moderately priced classics in a wide variety of colors and styles. He also included his FH2Tees line, which featured casual pieces in dark blue and black denim. Luxury pieces from his top-end line, Francis Hendy, were also in stock. As fashion lovers flocked to his slick new shop, his 2003 collection received rave reviews for its textural variation and luxurious materials. A deeply spiritual man and a born-again Christian, Hendy credited much of his success to his faith. Nonetheless, Hendy still struggled. The shaky post 9\/11 economy forced Hendy to shut his Soho shop after only a year. Back in the Garment District show room, Hendy and team found it difficult to keep up with customer demand. With his skill, family, and faith behind him, it seems that Hendy can't miss.

One evening at a party hosted by the Porters in Venice, Linda introduced the young bon vivant to Coco Chanel. Already at height of her fame. It was an introduction that would forever change his life. \n Chanel hired him as a textile designer, and it did not take long for her to become impressed with his eccentric taste and modern sensibilities. At this time, Chanel received an abundance of jewelry from her admirers, each piece very different from her own aesthetic sensibility. Chanel and Fulco shared not only a fascination with jewelry, but also a rebellious creative vision. Recognizing his genius for the whimsical and innovative, Chanel elevated Fulco to head designer, in charge of creating her private and boutique jewelry collections. \n   Fulco worked for Chanel for eight years. They traveled throughout Europe together visiting exhibits and museums; the \u201cByzantime\u201d look became the inspiration for Chanel jewelry. It was during this period that Verdura\u2019s signature motif, the Maltese Cross, came to be. Fulco moved across the Atlantic with his friend Nicky de Gunzberg in 1934. They toured America in a new Packard convertible, starting in New York, the Palm Beach and, finally, Hollywood. Fulco eventually settled in New York with hopes of applying his design experience. Introduced by Diana Vreeland, one of Chanel\u2019s best clients, he landed a stint with Paul Flato. \u201cVerdura for Flato\u201d was soon recognized and admired by the fashion world. Inspired by classical patterns and natural forms, Verdura mixed precious and semi-precious stones in bowknots, on seashells and on winged-hearts. With a demand for more glamorous jewels in Hollywood, Fulco traveled to the West Coast and stayed with Cole Porter on extended trips. His Sicilian-themed designs caught the eye of many Hollywood elite, including celebrities like Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda and jack Benny, and leading ladies such as Joan Crawford, Katharina Hepburn, Jean Howard, Loretta Young and Greta Garbo. In fact, the Curb-link bracelet watch was a lifelong favorite of Garbo\u2019s, and she was often photographed wearing it. With the backing of Cole and Linda Porter, Fulco opened his own shop on September 1, 1939. The 1940s continued to bring great renown to Fulco and a deepening friendship with the Porters. Fulco became close friends with some of his most fashionable and respected clients, including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Mona Bismarck, Doris Duke, Slim Keith and the three Cushing sisters, who marrid into very prominent New York families. It was one of these sisters, Babe Paley, a style icon of the era, who became his muse and set the tone for his career as a high-society designer in the \u201850s and \u201860s until his retirement in 1973 at the age of 75. In 1985, Ward Landrigan, formerly the head of Sotheby\u2019s USA jewelry division and a longtime admirer of Fulco die Verdura\u2019s jewelry, purchased the company, including nearly 10.000 of Fulco\u2019s original sketches. The New York salon opened at its current location overlooking Central Park, and today the glamour and vibrancy of Verdura remains as inspirational as the man himself.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Verdura"]}

Frederick Krolle, a master saddle maker, foresaw that the advent of steamships and railways would fuel the elegant traveller\u2019s needs for luxury leather luggage trunks and accessories. \n He developed trunks with designs, functions and materials which supported the travel style of the European nobility of the time who required everything necessary for a journey packed to accompany them. \n The late 19th century further saw the dawn of the modern automobile era. Frederick Krolle started producing car trunks that were designed to be waterproof and dustproof so that they could be fixed to the rear luggage area of a motorcar. After that, elaborate trunks were produced for long international maritime journeys. \n   Entering the 1920s, commercial airways for passangers and postal use were expanded globally. Tourism accordingly began to boom and the Krolle collection naturally evolved to include lighter weight bags. Tanner Krolle has always been at the forefront of innovation.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Tanner Krolle"]}

{"designer_name":"Frederic Boucheron","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/frederic-boucheron\/"],"biography":"Prestigious French jewellery house. Before opening his own jewellery store in 1858, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boucheron apprenticed at the fashionable Parisian jewellery house Deschamps. When Deschamps retired, he discouraged Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric from entering the jewellery trade, calling him \u201cnot cut out to be the proprietor of a business.\u201d Nonetheless, Boucheron persevered. The firm he founded, Boucheron, has become one of most important jewellery houses of our time. \n Though he started with little capital and a small stock of jewellery, Boucheron quickly attracted Parisian trendsetters\u2019 attention. Among his specialities were lacy gold metalwork embellished with diamonds, engraved diamonds (uncommon still today) and delicate plique-a-jour enamelling. The gemstones he used were carefully selected for color and quality. Even Boucheron\u2019s most accomplished competitors, like Andr\u00e9 Massin, praised the firm's pieces for their \u201cfaultless craftsmanship.\u201d The jewels were also unusual. \n As fellow jeweller and historian Henri Vever said, Boucheron made pieces that \u201cvery few of his colleagues would have dared to make at the time.\u201dThe firm thus developed a faithful and growing clientele. Among its clients was Tiffany and Company. \n   In 1867, Boucheron won a grand prize for jewellery at Paris\u2019s International Exposition for pieces in the archaeological revival and Louis XVI styles. In 1876, the French government presented Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boucheron with a Legion of Honor award for his jewellery. Awards from international expositions woudl roll in for the next fifty years. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric would not see all of them. He died in 1902, leaving the firm to his son Louis. The business was in good shape. Nine years earlier, in 1893, Boucheron had taken up residence at 26 Place Vend\u00f4me, Paris. By the turn of the century, the firm had enough name recognition, and capital, to open branch stores in London and New York. In the early 1930\u2019s, the firm expanded its presence to the Middle East and South America. Fred and G\u00e9rard Boucheron, Louis\u2019s sons, literally carried Boucheron\u2019s jewellery all over the globe, offering private showings to important clients. As the twentieth century reared its head, the firm stayed at the cutting edge of fashion. It produced exquisite Art Nouveau, Edwardian, and Art Deco pieces. During the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s, Boucheron popularized detachable dress clips, i.e., clips that could be worn separately or combined into a single piece, depending on one\u2019s outfit or mood. Like others during the Retro period, its designers made ample use of three-dimensional motifs, flexible chains, and tassels. In 1962, control of the firm passed to G\u00e9rard\u2019s son, Alain. Under his direction, the firm returned to materials it had used at the beginning of the century: rock crystal quartz, coral, wood, turquoise. In the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s, Boucheron designers were keen to mix such materials with diamonds and other precious stones to create large, impressive pieces. To this day, the firm\u2019s designs often feature bubbly, carved multicolour gemstones. Geometric lines, tassels, mesh\u2014 design elements from the firm\u2019s past\u2014are combined with modern design components. Its reputation for unsurpassed quality and design continues.","the_look":"His ruby, emerald and sapphire butterflies, enameled dragonflies decorated with brilliants, silver and gold leaves attracted the attention of the famous and the noble right away.

Frederic Boucheron decorated the roses, lizards, ladybirds, bees and tortoises with pearls, brilliants, enamel and sapphires. He was an expert in gem stones. A 152- karat sapphire he placed in the middle of one of his jewels made history as the biggest and clearest example of its kind.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1988 Boucheron (W)","1991 Boucheron (M)","1994 Jaipur (W)","1998 Jaipur Homme (M)","1999 Jaipur Saphir (W)","2000 Initial (W)","2004 Trouble (W)","2004 Jaipur Homme Fraicheur Epicee (M)","2005 Trouble eau Legere (W)","2006 Boucheron Eau Legere (W)","2006 Boucheron Eau Legere 2006 (M)","2006 Jaipur Homme Fraicheur (M)","2007 Miss Boucheron (W)","2008 B (W)","2008 Miss Boucheron Jeweler Edition \u2013 Miss Boucheron Eau de Parfume (W)","2008 Boucheron Homme Eau de Toilette Fraicheur 2008 (M)","Initial Perle de Soleil (W)","Jeweler Boucheron Edition \u2013 Boucheron Eau de Parfume (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Boucheron"]}

From a very early age, he develops a growing interest for all mechanical devices. It does not take long before the young Franck starts to disassemble all the machines in the house to study their \"hearts\". During his teens, he collects antique astrological instruments that he buys at the flea market. Mechanics and time, an equation reveals itself naturally: it is Time to which he is going to devote himself. \n He enters the famous Geneva School of Watch making in 1981. After 4 years of remarkable studies, he receives the highest distinction and prizes. Faithful to his independence of state and mind, he chooses the most difficult path: to create his own workshop instead of joining a brand or a group of watchmakers. It does not take long before his reputation is made: gifted by exception technical talent, auction houses and collectors from all over the world send him their treasures for restoration. \n After a few years in this field, he starts the creation of unique timepieces under his own name. Throughout his studies and first years as a watch restorer, Franck Muller comes to a conclusion regarding the horology world: since XIXth century, few technical inventions have been developed and applied to wristwatches. Willing to change this situation, he decides to devote his work to the realization of unique timepieces, wristwatches to be specific, which offer the same level of technical feats as those presented in pocket watches. This prerogative becomes a goal that the young entrepreneur will always hold at hearth. \n   In 1983, after months of research and micro-mechanical tests, Franck Muller is proud to present his first wristwatches. They all present a complicated movement that has been entirely created by him. Every year since 1986, Franck Muller has been presenting his World Premieres, based on prestigious complications. These creations are technical feats coveted by collectors throughout the world and are already regarded as milestones in the history of Fine Watchmaking. In 1992, Franck Muller founded his own company and, in the same year, created the most complicated wristwatch in the world. In 1995, a new administrative and production site was opened in Genthod, the \"foundation stone\" for the consolidation and instituionalization of the name. In response to his growing success, Franck Muller has created a new watchmaking concept and site, name FRANCK MULLER WATCHLAND, opened in March 2001. 2001 is also the year of the creation of the first jewellery collections by Franck Muller.

He studied art at the Parsons School of Applied Arts and Design in Paris. \n In 1921, American composer Irving Berlin spotted 18-year-old Adrian\u2019s costume on a model while attending the Beaux Arts. Berlin was looking for fresh designs for his \"Music Box Review\", and asked Adrian to come to New York and work on some costume designs for the show. Later he worded with Cecil B. DeMille when he began working in Hollywood at Pathe Sudios and in 1925, when DeMille transferred to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Adrian went with him. \n   As studio designer at MGM studios (1928-41), he crated glamorous clothing for such stars as Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, and Katharine Hepburn, his opulent designs dominated American fashion in the 1930s and 40s. In 1939, Adrian married Academy Award-winning actress Janet Gaynor. Their son, Robin, was born in 1940. In 1945, he won the Coty Award for his contribution to world fashion. When he retired from MGM, he opened Adrian Ltd. in Beverly Hills, CA, in 1942 and ran a fashionable salon until 1952. In addition to custom work, Adrian did a ready-to-wear line. To make the ready-to-wear line more exclusive, he allowed only one store in each city to sell his clothes. Adrian\u2019s design successes in California were often mirrored on New York\u2019s Seventh Avenue, which \"translated\" many of Adrian\u2019s movie clothes into American ready-to-wear outfits. Adrian \"knock-offs\" were seen everywhere. Some manufacturers would produce similarly fashioned garments which they called the \"Adrian silhouette\". After suffering a heart attack in 1952, Adrian closed his business, and he and his family retired to a ranch near Brasilia, Brazil, devoting time to painting landscapes.

Adrian contributed greatly to establishing Hollywood as the glamour capital of the world.

After a brief career as a photographer, he got his first job as a window dresser in the LaRinascente departmental store, in Milan. After working some time, he became Junior Buyer. \n 1964 He left La Rinascente and joined Nino Cerruti where he worked as a designer for his menswear company Hitman. \n   197O Armani started a company with his friend Sergio Galeotti, who was an architectural draftsman. For five years, they freelanced with various manufacturers and designed for others. He made women\u2019s clothes for Tendresse, mannish coats for Gibo, a ready-to-wear house in Florence and also made two menswear collections for Emanuel Ungaro, from whom he learned the good cutting techniques he needed. 1974 Giorgio held the first show in his own name. 1975 Giorgio Armani launched his own label with the founding of the Giorgio Armani Company. On April 5th 1982, Giorgi was on the cover of Time Magazine. He was the first Italian designer to be so honoured, and only the second after Dior. 1983 He received the CFDA International Award. Armani achieved his international breakthrough by tailoring for numerous Hollywood names and especially for Richard Gere in the title role of American Gigolo in 1980. In 2001, Forbes named him the most successful Italian designer, estimating his net worth at $1.7 billion; in giving him the same title five years later, the magazine estimated his fortune had grown to $4.1 billion. Armani was among the first designers to ban models with a body mass index (BMI) under 18, after model Ana Carolina Reston starved herself to death due to anorexia nervosa. In January 2007 Armani became the first designer to broadcast a haute couture fashion show live on the Internet. The Armani Prive spring\/summer 2007 fashion show was broadcast via Microsoft Corporation\u2019s MSN and Cingular cellular phones. Giorgio Armani has a keen interest in sport; he is the president of Olimpia Milano basketball team, an Inter Milan fan and has twice designed suits for the England national football team. He has been responsible for the suits worn by England's Chelsea FC since August 2007. He designed the ceremonial Italian flag-bearers' outfits at the 2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony in Turin.","the_look":"Following the phenomenal success of his menswear, Armani used the elements of masculine tailoring to make feminine garments. Armani understands how to make a suit sexy. He made jackets without stiff linings, opened up the armholes, deleted superfluous buttons and re-figured the proportions. He used soft slinky dress fabrics to make jackets, so lacking in starch that they could scarcely hold a crease. The design of the Armani jacket is far removed from traditional principles of jacket tailoring. On ordinary jackets, the shoulders fit tightly, the waist is apparent and it hits the breast. His jackets do not do any of these. He makes the shoulder sloping, giving the illusion of a longer neck, the fabric at the collar is pared away, again lengthening the neck, and the whole effect is restrained and languid, not at all masculine. His clothes have a sense of control and the lack of fuss and clutter make women feel comfortable. Armani uses a dense weave of 5 or even 8 strands of different colours, which at a distance merge into a neutral. This can be called beige, or stone, pearl, mink, sludge, etc. In all cases he stresses simplicity, and minimalism. He hardly uses accessories or jewellery in his collections. His style is the perfect bridge between refined elegance and down-to-earth comfort.","who_wears_it":["Jodie Foster","Michelle Pfeiffer","Richard Gere","Goldie Hawn","Sharon Stone."],"perfumes":["1982 Armani le Parfum (W)","1984 Armani (M)","1984 Armani Mens cologne","1992 Gio (W)","1994 Arman Eau pour homme","1995 Acqua di Gio (W)","1997 Acqua di Gio for men","1998 Emporio Armani (His and Hers)","1999 Mania (W)","2001 Emporio Armani white (W) and (M)","2001 Emporio Armani black (M)","2002 Armani Mania (M)","2002 Sensi (W)","2003 Emporio Armani Night (M)","2003 Emporio Armani Night (W)","2003 Emporio Armani Nicht Elle (W)","2004 Sensi White Notes (W)","2004 Black Code (M)","2004 Armani Mania (W)","2005 Armani Code (M)","2006 Armani Code (W)","2007 Armani Attitude (M)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Giorgio Armani","Emporio Armani","Armani Prive","Armani Junior","Armani Jeans","Armani Exchange","Armani Collezioni","Armani Casa","Ea7"]}

He was among the first American designers to produce and sell his collections in Europe. He was also one of the first American designers to have a chain of boutiques in Europe and Japan. Beene developed a menswear business that led to a licence agreement with Van Heusen for shirts. He also created fragrances for men and women. 1976 Beene was the first American designer to show his collections in Milan, Italy followed up with Rome, Paris, Brussels and Vienna. 1989 Beene opened his retail shop on 5th Avenue in New York, \u201cGeoffrey Beene on the Plaza\u201d. In 1991 he became actively interest in Home Furnishing design. 1994 Honoured with a Retrospective exhibition at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. 1996 Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana proclaimed April 27th as \"Geoffrey Beene Day\" in the State. His designs were displayed in several galleries and museums, including New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology in 1994 and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in 2002. He was an innovator in business as well. He died in September 2004, at the age of 80, at his home in Manhattan, New York. Geoffrey had the last laugh, since the whole world reported that he was 77, although he had quietly celebrated his 80th birthday a short while earlier. the label Today's Geoffrey Beene Inc. is a fashion empire comprised of women's couture and men\u2019s and women\u2019s ready-to-wear, men's accessories and fragrance. With a dedicated design team at company headquarters working in concert with a network of premiere licensees, the Geoffrey Beene label continues to uphold the design aesthetic that was signature Beene.  The Geoffrey Beene brand is carried throughout the U.S. in better department and specialty stores, and in Geoffrey Beene outlet stores. After Geoffrey Beene\u2019s dead in 2004 the company continued unter the dirction of President G. Thompson Hutton, Senior Vice-President\/Chief Operating Officer Russell Nardozza and Design Director Einar Holiloekk. The women\u2019s couture collection is exclusively housed at the company's New York City studio. Today, Geoffrey Beene woman's couture collection is exclusively housed at the company's atelier on 57th street in New York City under the direction of Beene prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and design director Einar Holiloekk.","the_look":"Beene made strong impressions with his courteous manner as well as his highly original style. On the one hand, he was a champion of minimalist design. The short, A-line dresses and body-contoured jumpsuits he was known for were marvels of cut and proportion. At the same time, his evening collections featured layers of fabrics and prints, some of them embroidered with dots and trimmed with delicate lace. Everything he designed had a hand-crafted, artisan\u2019s quality that made more familiar-looking clothes seem predictable. Beene was among the first designers of his level to use fine-quality rayon and other synthetic fabrics for his collections, partly because they resisted wrinkles. He sometimes worked with Asian manufacturers to create his own prints. One memorable fabric reproduced the scales of a shark\u2019s skin. Beene\u2019s view of style was more about function than fad. He also cautioned against getting too concerned with the latest trends. His clothes were structured but never rigid and rely on the craftsmanship of careful detail. Many of his designs contained an element of fantasy. He had a casual approach to opulent fabrics, successfully blending them with less expensive materials, for example flannel trimmed with rhinestones, quilted ticking cotton with chiffon, or jersey with taffeta. He did much to blur the difference between sportswear and other clothes, like his strapless Grecian draped tennis frocks, or jogging clothes with glittering piping. He made rich and imaginative clothes and showed his creativity by designing with a relaxed elegance. From his high-priced couture collections, to his lower priced Beene Boutique and Bazaar lines, as well as his Beene Bag sportswear line, he offered flexible wardrobes of inter-related pieces. His colours could be bright and bracing like red, or earthy and subtle.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1971 Geoffrey","1975 Grey Flannel for men","1976 Red (W)","1987 Bowling Green for men","1994 Chance (W)","1996 Eau de Grey Flannel","1998 Geoffrey Beene"],"social_media":"","brands":["Gianfranco Ferr"]}
{"designer_name":"Gabriellechanel","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/gabriellechanel\/"],"biography":"  Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel was born in August 19, 1883 in Saumur, France. She was a pioneering French couturier whose modernist philosophy, menswear-inspired fashions, and pursuit of expensive simplicity made her arguably the most important figure in the history of 20th-century fashion design. \n When she was 12, her mother died and her father, who was a travelling wine peddler, left her and her sister in a convent and disappeared forever. The convent was sad experiences for 6 years, for poor girls kept apart from the paying girls, wore a different uniform and were looked down on. A friend said much later that Coco was trying to put all the world's women into the uniform she wore then, a black dress with white collar. \n   At 18 she left the convent and worked in a tailoring shop but she aspired to be a music hall performer and tried singing for a while. Balsan\u2019s home was a magnet for his numerous hunting friends and their fashionable mistresses. After a couple affairs with generous wealthy men \u2013 a military officer and later a English Industiralist \u2013 she was able to open a shop in Paris in 1909, selling ladies simply decorated hats from Balsan\u2019s ground floor Paris apartment. Arthur \u201cboy\u201d Capel was a member of Balsan\u2019s circle, and he was the only one who worked for a living. Chanel became infatuated with him. As a businessman, he recognized a potential business- woman in Chanel and in 1910, set her up in a small shop on the Rue Cambon in Paris. Her influence on haute couture was such that she was the only person in the field to be named on the List of TIME Magazine\u2019s 100 most influential people of the 20th century. Since there was already a couture shop in the building, her lease forbade her to also make couture dresses. In 1911 and 1912, rich ladies came to Deauville and Biarritz, the resort towns, for the races and the women vied to out do each other with frills, flounces, huge hats, tight corsets, long skirts and everything that Chanel detested. In 1913 she and Capel set up shops of her. Little did they all know that within a year Deauville would be within earshot of the guns on the front lines of World War I, which would change this \"belle epoch\" and it's fashions forever. Chanel was going to be part of a fashion revolution, not just in the radical simplicity of her style but even in the materials she used to achieve it and particularly the accessories she used. During the War years, she moved into a larger shop on rue Cambon, across from the Ritz hotel. She started selling flannel blazers, straight linen skirts, sailor tops, long jersey sweaters and skirt-jacket Her suits even before 1920, had above-the-ankle skirts, three-quarter length coats loosely belted to reveal blouses that matched the jacket lining. Harpers Bazaar started mentioning her in 1915 and by 1917 said that \"Chanel's\u201d name is on the lips of every buyer. In her salon at 31 rue Cambon, she piled cushions of feathers, fur and metallic fabrics on the sofas in the gray and amber salons and showed increasingly simple day dress-and-coat ensembles, often in \"biscuit\" jersey (later called beige) as well as black evening dresses in lace or jet-embroidered tulle. During the Twenties, Chanel really established herself as the Queen of Fashion. Like most couturiers of the Twenties, Chanel designed beaded dresses, and of course, hers were different. Chanel introduced her first costume jewellery in 1924 (a pair of pearl earrings, one black, one white) and she now began to elaborate this vision. Chanel's early-Twenties Russian look has been attributed to her liaison with Russian Grand Duke Dmitri. Chanel's most famous design - instantly recognized in it's hundreds of variations - is the suit in two or three pieces. First made around 1920 it is still popular today. No less a Chanel trademark is the \"little black dress\" which she was advocating as the new uniform for afternoon and evening as far back as 1915. As her business grew, so did Chanel's social desirability and her personal legend. Her success and her fortune were her entree and she manipulated them brilliantly. She now had a new lover the Duke of Westminster. Chanel No. 5-5 was Coco Chanel's lucky number. In 1921 when Earnest Beaux created a new perfume for Gabrielle Chanel, she used her lucky number. This was the perfume that would make her fortune. Her trade-mark simplicity was expressed in the shape of the bottle, a design which has never been altered and helps to make it the world's largest selling perfume. During the Twenties, Chanel really established herself as the Queen of Fashion. Two of her most famous creations are Chanel No. 5 perfume, launched in 1923, and the influential Chanel suit, an elegant suit comprised of a knee-length skirt and trim, boxy jacket, traditionally made of woven wool with black trim and gold buttons and worn with large costume-pearl necklaces. In 1924 Chanel introduced her first costume jewellery (a pair of pearl earrings, one black, one white) and she now began to elaborate this vision. She also popularized the little black dress, whose blank-slate versatility allowed it to be worn for day and evening, depending on how it was accessorized. Although unassuming black dresses existed before Chanel, the ones she designed were considered that haute couture standard. In 1923, she told Harper\u2019s Bazaar that \u201csimplicity is the keynote of all true elegance\u201d. With the arrival of the Thirties, Chanel's evening clothes became more elongated, more feminine and by the end of the decade, almost fantastical. For summer evening dresses, she surprised with contrasting scintillating touches like rhinestone straps or silver eyelets. In 1937, struck by how small women looked when seated at the theatre, she showed a collection of head dresses designed to lend height; confections of tulle, silk flowers and the increasingly evident Chanel ribbon bow. A competitive situation developed in the thirties between Chanel and Elsa Schiaparelli, whom Chanel referred to as \"that Italian artist who makes clothes\". Schiaparelli's influence was only limited to the one decade but for this short time, she was the more sensational. This did not however force Chanel into trying to do the same thing. Her style was faultlessly elegant, modern and matchlessly chic. The Chanel style of elegance with a foundation of comfort, ease and practicality, continued throughout the thirties. In 1939 when World War II began, Chanel closed her salon and took up residence at the Ritz Hotel. From June 1940 the Nazi High Command had made the Ritz Hotel their headquarters so a rumour spread throughout Paris that Chanel was on more than friendly terms with the Germans. When Paris was liberated in 1945 the French took revenge on women who had collaborated with the Germans. However within a week of the liberation of Paris she left for Switzerland and she remained there until 1953. By 1953 Paris had forgotten Chanel. Dior's \"new look\" had everyone excited in 1947 and there were many new and successful designers in Paris. However Chanel, goaded primarily by the boredom of retirement and a decline in perfume sales, displayed here usual sense of perfect timing. The impact of the \"new look\" was waning and the stage was set for a return to elegant chic. At the age of 71 she prepared her new collection in her old salon on the rue Cambon. In 1957 she introduced her chain handled quilted leather handbags which have gone on to be so successful. She died on January 10th 1971 at the age of 88 still in harness, still designing, still working. After her death, the house of Chanel was looked after by Yvonne Dudel, Jean Cazaubon and Phlippe Guibourge. The Chanel suit and the Little Black Dress were sold in their usual vast quantities, and all the Chanel products sold very well, but the sparkle had gone. Pierre Wetheimer who had manufactured No. 5 for Coco Chanel, had bought the house. His grandson Alain Wertheimer, took over in 1974 when he was 25 years old. He spent a few years trying to restore Chanel's prestige and sought a new designer for the house. Chanel needed someone to put life back into the veritable house. The owner Alain Wertheimer persuaded Karl Lagerfeld to sever his contract with Chloe and become Chanel's chief designer for an annual salary of $ 1 million. In 1983 Karl Lagerfeld took over Chanel. the label Chanel is one of today\u2019s best known and highly sought-after fashion brands, and has been practically since it was founded by Coco (Gabrielle) Chanel in 1909. The luxury brand stands out in just about every category\u2014couture, ready-to-wear, accessories, jewellery, shoes, and fragrances.","the_look":"Although Chanel borrowed many details from men's wear, her suits were never imitating men. Usually soft and untailored, made in jersey, velvet, silk charmeuse or tweed, these suits share the practical constants of boxy cardigan jackets with sleeve buttons that really button up, pockets where one needs pockets and straight knee-length skirts with walking pleats. Chanel disapproved of suits that could be worn only with the jacket closed so she designed jackets that looked good open, closed or draped over a shoulder. She made blouses which were an integral part of the ensemble, using fabrics matching the suit's lining, printed in corresponding colours or made in school-girl white with immaculate collar and cuffs. Women are dependent on this look even today. Chanel\u2019s \u201clittle black dress\u201d was Deceptively simple, these dresses were wizardry's of cut and proportion. She used traditional elegant materials lace, tulle, embroideries, soft weightless silks - in a newly tailored way. Worn with a cardigan of the same fabric as the suit on the next hanger, the little black dress made women wearing anything else seem overdressed.","who_wears_it":["Everyone who\u2019s anyone.

{"designer_name":"Gianni Versace","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/gianni-versace\/"],"biography":"  Gianni Versace was regarded as the designer of choice by entertainers and professionals alike, who were attracted to his classics with an edge. He was full-bodied, flamboyant, and extravagant. He was the unopposed King of Glamour who built a $ l billion fashion empire. Gianni Versace was born on December2, 1946. His father Antonio was an appliance salesman and had a tailoring store in Reggio Calbria. As a young boy, he learned to design and make his own clothes. Several of his designs were sold at the family store.  At the age of nine, he designed his first dress, an off the shoulder velvet gown. He worked for his mother until he was 25. 1972 He moved to Milan and worked for a short time with Florentine Flowers, then with De Parisini of Santa Margherita. He designed some \"instant\" summer wear, which flew off the racks. 1973 He worked with Callaghan (Novara), Genny (Ancona), with Alma and also conceived and designed a line of his own called Complice. 1978 Versace opened his first shop on the via Spiga in Milan and presented his first signature collection as well as his first menswear collection. He used as his Logo, the head of MEDUSA the woman from ancient Greek legend, who had snakes instead of hair. 1982 He won the L'Occhio d'Oro for the best fashion designer for his Fall\/Winter collection, displaying the now famous metal garments made of light aluminium mesh. In 1985, his Instante collection hit the store stands. In 1989 he opened the Atelier Versace, a couture workshop. Versace presented Versus, a new line for young people looked after by Gianni's sister Donatella. 1990 Versace launched his Classic V2 line and his Signature line which interpreted his vision in easier versions. He also had the guts to put Jeans on the catwalk during a couture show, which rocked the fashion world. 1991 He received the L'Occhio d'Oro for the 4th time proclaiming him the most creative and innovative designer for men. In 1992 Gianni Versace moved to Miami Beach, Florida and purchased a home at 1116 Ocean Drive formerly known as the Amsterdam Palace for $2.9 million. 1992 Versace unveiled an array of leather bondage dresses, which accentuated sexuality. As usual, this caused a furore. 1993 He designed the new line Home Signature, a line of home furnishings and products. Furthermore Versace was awarded the coveted American Fashion Oscar, on February 1, 1993. 1994 A London newspaper made claims that Versace's empire was funded by the Mafia. He sued and received $ 150,000 settlement and a public apology. After receiving city approval to demolish the Revere Hotel next-door, a two-story, 6,100-foot addition was built transforming the entire structure into a palatial home which Versace named Casa Casuarina. Gianni Versace's initial connection with Miami, South Beach in particular, came when he designed the sensual T-shirt-and-pastel-jacket look for Miami Vice, a look that exuded a fresh style that would soon sweep the country and set the tone for a decade of wild and reckless living. Versace was murdered on July 15, 1997, at the age of 51, outside his Miami Beach mansion; he was shot to death on his front steps. Andrew Cunanan, who was wanted for murdering four other people in a killing spree (all of the victims, including Versace, homosexual), became a prime suspect. Cunanan fled and hid from the police. Eight days later he committed suicide in a houseboat on Miami Beach that was under siege by armed police. 1998 The Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of New York, held an exhibition of Gianni Versace's creations, from the ultra-classic to the cool and modern. His flair and daring will always be remembered. In late 2002, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London held a wonderful retrospective exhibition of Gianni Versace's most memorable gowns. This was attended by thousands of people and was most successful. \n the label \n   After the death of Gianni Versace, his sister, Donatella Versace, took over his business and continued usage of the family's trademark of using bright colors and designs. She was born in Reggio Calabria Italy, in 1959, being 13 years younger than Gianni. Brother and sister had a very close relationship and Gianni considered her his muse. She started as accessories designer, then took over Versace Young, the children's line. Then she was head designer for Versus, the youth line. Many good friends, including Giorgio Armani, showed up on Donatella's first runway show after Gianni's death, to give her support. The fashion world accepted her as a full-fledged designer. However the house of Versace experienced sagging sales for two years. However, in 2000 the house of Versace finally found a resurgence of sales. Donatella blossomed and in the last two years has become a premier fashion designer in her own right, and not just Gianni's little sister.","the_look":"He was one of the most important Italian designers of the 1980's and 90's, famous for his strong colour sense and clean lines. He like to wrap the female form, often with bias-cut clothes and fluid silks. Many of his ideas were audacious, but all were carried out to a high level of technical achievement. Versace viewed his clothes as powerful statement which were executed with unfailing confidence. Almost always the body was swathed or the garment wrapped in some manner. In his clothes, classical historical references blend with bold geometric shapes and complex textures in brilliant colours. His designs are unmistakable, he enjoyed working with leather and experimenting with new fabrics and trimmings. His designs for the theatre and ballet, undoubtedly influenced his fashion work.","who_wears_it":["Courtney Love","Jon Bon Jovi","Elton John","Liz Hurley","Katherine Zeta-Jones","Virginia Madsen","Drew Barrymore","Melanie Griffiths","Halle Berry","Beyonce"],"perfumes":["1984 Gianni Versace (W)","1984 Versace l\u2019Homme (M)","1989 V\u2019E Versace (W)","1991 Versus Donna","1991 Versus (M)","1993 Mediterraneum (M)","1994 Red Jeans (W)","1994 Blue Jeans (M)","1995 Baby Rose Jeans (W)","1995 Blonde (W)","1995 Baby blue Jeans (W)","1995 Pink Jeans (M)","1995 Green Jeans (M)","1996 Yellow Jeans (W)","1996 Versus V (W)","1996 The Dreamer (M)","1997 White Jeans (W)","1997 Black Jeans (M)","2000 Metal Jeans Women","2000 Metal Jeans (M)","2000 2Thousand","2000 Versace Woman","2000 Essence Emotional","2000 Essence Ethereal","2000 Essence Exciting","2002 Jeans Couture (W)","2002 Jeans Couture (M)","2003 Mediterranean Sport (W)","2003 Jeans Couture Glam (W)","2003 Versace Man","2004 Crystal Noir (W)","2006 Bright Crystal (W)","Versus","2001 Time for Energy (U)","2001 Time for Pleasure (W)","2001 Time to Relax (U)","2003 Time for Action (M)","1984 Gianni Versace (W)","1984 Versace l\u2019Homme (M)","1989 V\u2019E Versace (W)","1991 Versus Donna","1991 Versus (M)","1993 Mediterraneum (M)","1994 Red Jeans (W)","1994 Blue Jeans (M)","1995 Baby Rose Jeans (W)","1995 Blonde (W)","1995 Baby blue Jeans (W)","1995 Pink Jeans (M)","1995 Green Jeans (M)","1996 Yellow Jeans (W)","1996 Versus V (W)","1996 The Dreamer (M)","1997 White Jeans (W)","1997 Black Jeans (M)","2000 Metal Jeans Women","2000 Metal Jeans (M)","2000 2Thousand","2000 Versace Woman","2000 Essence Emotional","2000 Essence Ethereal","2000 Essence Exciting","2002 Jeans Couture (W)","2002 Jeans Couture (M)","2003 Mediterranean Sport (W)","2003 Jeans Couture Glam (W)","2003 Versace Man","2004 Crystal Noir (W)","2006 Bright Crystal (W)","Versus","2001 Time for Energy (U)","2001 Time for Pleasure (W)","2001 Time to Relax (U)","2003 Time for Action (M)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Versace Collection","Versace","Versace Jeans Couture","V2 Versace Classic","Gianni Versace Couture","Versace Home","Versace Sport","Versus","Versus Watches","Versace Watches"]}
{"designer_name":"Gimmo Etro","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/gimmo-etro\/"],"biography":"  \"Etro\" is synonymous of style. It is a lifestyle based upon quality and sophistication, not only in terms of design, but also regarding materials and production techniques. This universe of elegance derives from Gimmo Etro's innate passion for travel and history, which has now become the leitmotif of all the lines of the fashion maison. \n The history of Etro began in 1968 when Gimmo Etro started his entrepreneurial adventure as a material converter for clothing, giving life to a production of luxury fabrics made with noble and natural fibres such as cashmere, silk, linen and cotton, adorned with original designs and innovative colourings. \n   In the beginning, his company produced superb fabrics made of fine original fibers, decorated with elegant designs and dyed in chic colors. The Paisley motif first appeared in the Etro collections back in 1981. It was not only a masterpiece of the production, but it also became a symbol of the Etro brand, and would remain so for years to come. The fashion fabrics line was soon joined by the men's and women's accessory collections that always expressed ideas through fine materials and original decorations. The next step was a new leather goods line. The paisley jacquard fabric treated with a special plasticization technique became a status symbol of the chic Eighties. The home and the accessories that make it an elegant ambiance were the next objectives in Etro's creative and production development.  The home accessories line dressed homes with incomparable, striking style. The Nineties marked Etro's debut in the pret-a-porter fashion world. Style and research focused on men's and women's collections, revealing extraordinary craftsmanship combined with an original, creative choice in materials and tailoring solutions. The \"New Tradition\" was born, and would become one of the strongest, most unique concepts of the Etro brand.","the_look":"Dazzlingly printed separates constructed with lustrous fabrics and cast in offbeat color combinations.","who_wears_it":["Amanda Hearst","Elizabeth Kieselstein-Cord","Rocco di Spirito"],"perfumes":["1988 Etro Heliotrope (W)","1989 Etro Ambra (U)","1989 Etro Gomma (U)","1989 Etro Lemon Sorbet (U)","1989 Etro Royal Pavilion (U)","1989 Etro Sandolo (U)","1989 Etro Vetiver (U)","1989 Etro Magot (W)","1989 Etro Palais Jamais (W)","1989 Etro Vicolo Fiori (W)","1994 Etro Messe de Minuit (U)","1997 Etro Shaal Nur (U)","1998 Etro Patchouly (W)","1999 Etro Etra (U)","2001 Benetroesser Raving (W)","2001 Benetroesser Relent (W)","2001 Benetroesser Resort (W)","2002 Etro New Tradition (W)","2003 Magot (W)","2004 Anice (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Etro"]}
{"designer_name":"Guccio Gucci","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/guccio-gucci\/"],"biography":"  Gucci, or the House of Gucci, is an Italian haute couture establishment. It was founded by Guccio Gucci in Florence in 1921. Like many other high-fashion companies, Gucci began as a small, family-owned saddler and leather goods store. \n Guccio Gucci was the son of an Italian merchant form the country\u2019s northern manufacturing region. In 1898 Guccio Gucci left Florence in Italy to traveled to Paris and London, where he \u201cgained an appreciation of cosmopolitan culture, sophistication, and aesthetics\u201d. \n   So in 1905 he returned to Italy and started selling saddles and saddlebags, and was quite successful. Gucci opened his first boutique in the family\u2019s native Florence in 1921 and quickly built a reputation for quality, hiring the best craftsmen he could find to work in his atelier. In 1932 Guccio Gucci created the loafer shoe with a gilded snaffle. These are the only shoes to have found a place in New York's Museum of Modern Art. In 1938, Gucci expanded and a boutique was opened in Rome. Guccio was responsible for designing many of the company\u2019s most notable products. In 1947, Gucci introduced the bamboo handle handbag, which is still a company mainstay. Guccio and his wife Aida Calvelli had a large family, six children in all, though only his sons \u2013 Vasco, Aldo, Ugo, and Rodolfo \u2013 would play a role in leading the company. After Guccio\u2019s death in 1953, Aldo helped lead the company to a position of international prominence, opening the company\u2019s first boutiques in London, Paris and New York Even in Gucci\u2019s fledgling years, the family was notorious for its ferocious infighting. Disputes regarding inheritances, stock holdings, and day-to-day operations of the stores often divided the family and led to alliances. As the Gucci expanded overseas, board meetings about the company\u2019s future often ended with tempers flaring and luggage and purses flying. Gucci targeted the Far East for further expansion in the late 1960s, opening stores in Hong Kong and Tokyo. At that time, the company also developed its famous GG logo (Guccio Gucci\u2019s initials), the Flora silk scarf (worn prominently by Hollywood yctress Grace Kelly), and the Jakie O shoulder bag, made famous by Jackie Kennedy, the wife of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Gucci remained one of the premier luxury goods establishments in the world until the late 1970s, when a series of disastrous business decisions and family quarrels brought the company to the verge of bankruptcy. At the time, brothers Aldo and Rodolfo controlled equal 50% shares of the company, though Aldo felt that his brother contributed less to the company that he and his sons did. In 1979, Aldo developed the Gucci Accessories Collection, or GAC, intended to bolster the sales for the Gucci Parfums sector, which his sons controlled. Aldo relegated control of Parfums to his son Roberto in an effort to weaken Rodolfo\u2019s control of the overall operations of the company. Though the Gucci Accessories Collection was well received, it proved to be the destabilizing force that brought the Gucci dynasty crashing down. Within a few years, the Parfums division began outselling the Accessories division. The newly-founded wholesaling business had brought the once-exclusive brand to over a thousand stores in the United States alone with the GAC line, deteriorating the brand\u2019s standing with fashionable customers. It didn\u2019t take long before counterfeiters ravaged the company\u2019s pomp by flooding the market with cheap knockoffs, further tarnishing the Gucci name. Meanwhile, infighting was taking its toll on the operations of the company back in Italy: Rodolfo and Aldo squabbled over the Parfums division, of which Rodolfo controlled a meager 20% stake. By the mid-1980s, when Aldo was convicted of tax evasion in the United States by the testimony of his own son, the outrageous headlines of gossip magazines generated as much publicity for Gucci as its designs. In 1983 Rudolfo died of cancer, Maurizio his, inherited his share and took over running the business. Maurizio allied with Aldo\u2019s son Paolo to gain control of the Board of Directors and established the Gucci Licensing division in the Netherlands for tax purposes. Following the decision, the rest of the family left the company and, for the first time in years, one man was at the helm of Gucci. Maurizio sought to bury the fighting that had torn the company and his family apart and turned to talent outside of the company for Gucci\u2019s future. In 1989, Maurizio managed to persuade Dawn Mello, whose revival of New York\u2019s Bergdorf Goodman in the 1970s made her a star in the retail business, to join the newly-formed Gucci Group as creative director. At the helm of Gucci America was Domenico De Sole, a former lawyer who helped oversee Maurizio\u2019s takeover of the company and the purchase of the company\u2019s remaining shares by Investcorp, a Bahrain-based holding company between 1987 and 1989. The last addition to the creative team, which already included designers from Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein, was a young designer named Tom Ford. Raised in Texas an New Mexico, he had been interested in fashion since his early teens but only decided to pursue a career as a designer after dropping out of Parsons School of Design in 1986 as an architecture major. Dawn Mello hired Ford in 1990 at the urging of his partner, writer and editor Richard Buckley. During the 90's, there was a lot of bad feeling between Maurizio Gucci and Investcorp which resulted in litigation. Dawn Mello returned to her job at Bergdorf Goodman less than a year after Maurizio\u2019s departure, and the position of creative director went to Tom Ford, then just 32 years old. Ford had worked for years under the uninspiring direction of Maurizio and Mellow and wanted to take the company\u2019s image in a new direction. De Sole, who had been elevated to CEO, realized that if Gucci was to become a profitable company, it would require a new image, and so he agreed to pursue Ford\u2019s vision. Ford had long been an avid follower of two of America\u2019s top designers, Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein. Klein, much like Ford, was a \u201csuperstar designer,\u201d the exemplar of his own brand: stylish, suave, and modern. His scandalous advertisements made the brand synonymous with eternal youth and the mystery of adolescent sexuality. In 1995 Maurizio Gucci was murdered. His wife was convicted of his murder. In 1995, Tom Ford's \"Jet Set\" collection with velvet hipsters and satin bodyshirts in jewel colours was the sexiest of the season. He went on with such success that the company turned around and is now operating very successfully. Now each season, Gucci gets better and better. Tom Ford's approach has proved to be perfect and right up to now, Gucci is one of the most profitable Italian designer houses, being a million dollar concern. Domenico De Sole was incensed by the news and declined Arnault\u2019s request for a spot on the board of directors, where he would have access to Gucci\u2019s confidential earnings reports, strategy meetings, and design concepts. De Sole reacted by issuing new shares of stock in an effort to dilute the value of Arnault\u2019s holdings. The second largest shareholder is Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais with 11%. After a failed attempt at contract renewal with PPR in 2003, Tom Ford and Domenico de Sole decided to take their leave from Gucci Group. In March 2004, it has been announced that the new Creative Director of Gucci Women\u2019s wear is Alessandra Facchinetti. She joined Gucci in 2000 and has worked for four years alongside Tom Ford, who found her a talented perfectionist in making the luxurious garments for which the house is renowned. Taking over from Domenico de Sole, will be Dutchman Robert Polet (born 1955) who was with Unilever. He will join on July 1st 2004 and has global experience of running multi-national companies. After only one year, and two collections, Alessandra Fachinetti has decided to leave Gucci and has resigned. \"Disagreements with management\" has been mentioned as the reason. Gucci has announced that Frida Giannini will be taking over women\u2019s wear design. Frida was looking after the Gucci accessories line for two seasons, with great success. Prior to joining Gucci she spent 5 years designing at Fendi. Frida was chosen by Time magazine in April 2005, as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.","the_look":"Urban, aggressive seductress and her playboy consorts.

Ferre has become noted for his expert use of stark colours, especially red, black, white and gold, and his extravagant use of luxurious fabrics such as fur, leather and taffeta. He is however still able to insert a little fun into his garments, like this dress made of cane in a basket weave, for Spring 2000. One of the garments with which he is always connected, is the white blouse. He is renowned for the way he sculpts white cotton, silk, or his favourite organza into so many shapes. He has taken the white shirt and made it his own, elevating it far above a humble shirt. He uses beaded cuffs, lace ruffles, collars that soar like birds or that cut loose with billowing sleeves.

Seeing the design work of Norman Norell inspired Tassell\u2019s decision to create clothes for women. \n In the early 1950s Tassell moved to Europe where he did fashion sketches for Genevi\u00e9ve Fath and became acquainted with American designer James Galanos. It was through the encouragement of Galanos that Tassell eventually began his own business in 1956 in California, though the designs Tassell produced were closer in concept to those of Norell than Galanos. \n   He was awarded the prestigious Coty Award for American designers in 1961.

Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of the US President, ordered several of Gustave Tassell's dresses for her visit to India and Pakistan in 1962. In 1972, when Norman Norell died, Tassell was asked to come to New York to maintain the line. He did this under the name House of Norell, Gustave Tassell.

The look was graceful and feminine. Skirts could be bell shaped, or gathered gently. The seams of a princess-style dress curved to suggest the bust and waistline. He designed clothes for both evening and daytime wear\u2014separates, dresses, and coats. He designed versions of the black dinner dress, the shirtwaist, culottes, and the reefer coat.

Beer's clothes became so successful that he opened two more stores, one in Nizza, Italy and one in Monte Carlo. \n In 1931 the house merged with Agnes-Drecoll although Beer dresses continued to be made till 1953. \n   It is presumed that Herr Gustav Beer must have died about that time, probably aged in his late 70's or early 80's.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"George Barbier","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/george-barbier\/"],"biography":"George Barbier was one of the great French illustrators of the early 20th century. He was born in Nantes, France in 1882. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris from 1908 to 1910. His companions included his cousin Pierre Brissaud, Bernard Boutet de Monvel, Jean Besnard, Paul Iribe, Georges Lepape and Charles Martin, all of whom were to become world renowned fashion illustrators. \n Barbier was 29 years old when he mounted his first exhibition in 1911 and was subsequently swept to the forefront of his profession with commissions to design theatre and ballet costumes, to illustrate books, and to produce haute couture fashion illustrations. For the next 20 years Barbier led a group from the Ecole des Beaux Arts who were nicknamed by Vogue as \"The Knights of the Bracelet\" \u2013 a tribute to their fashionable and flamboyant mannerisms and style of dress \n In that year several important new Paris fashion magazines began to be published, Gazette du Bon Ton, Le Journal des Dames et des Modes, Feuillets d'Art, Femina and Vogue. He became the chief illustrator for many of these magazines. \n   Barbier also illustrated albums of ballet dancers and made wood engravings. Barbier was one of many artists who illustrated limited \"editions de luxe\" intended as collectors items. A mania for these books swept France in the teens and twenties. In 1913, he made an album of drawings of Nijinsky, the principal dancer of the Ballets Russes, in his various roles. The fashion plates Barbier drew for Bon Ton were almost exclusively for the house of Worth. They were prepared 6 to 12 months ahead of the collections and make one of the most complete couture series of the period. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 1925, several people joined Barbier deploring the boyish style of the 20's clothes, critical of the bisexual appearance, athleticism, and flat-chested asexual approach. During his career Barbier also turned his hand to jewellery, glass and wallpaper design, wrote essays and many articles for the prestigious Gazette du bon ton. Both Barbier and Erte were asked to design for American movies. Barbier sent his designs from Paris, where he was based. One of the films which used his costume designs was \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" starring Rudolph Valentino, in 1924. Barbier's designs were not so exotic as Erte's but certainly as lavish. He designed for many films up to 1930 The last show he worked on was \"Paris Shakes\" at the Casino de Paris with Josephine Baker. He died in 1932 at the age of only 50.","the_look":"Barbier's style seems to owe its outlines to Aubrey Beardsley and their colour to Leon Bakst. He was interested in both 18th century art and Art Nouveau and the strong influence of the latter can be seen in the curlicues and flowing shapes of his supple, fashionable women.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

He had trained with the Callot sisters in Paris for several years, prior to opening his own house. \n In 1900, there was an exhibition of Haute Couture gowns at the Paris Exposition Universelle. Georges Doeuillet was one of the couturiers to exhibit his creations at the exhibition. \n   Doeuillet designed highly detailed dresses of elaborate design, and was very successful throughout the first two decades of the 20th century. In 1915, he included in his collection a black velvet and taffeta dress with the newly popular tiered handkerchief hem. In 1917, he introduced the barrel-line silhouette. In 1919, one of his gowns was a white satin brocade chemise with the new straight look and short skirt, which anticipated the look of the 20's following by so many designers later. In 1926, he was right in fashion with his very short skirted black satin dress, brocaded with flowers, with an uneven butterfly hem. In 1929, Jacques Doucet died so Doeuillet took over his house and clientele as well as his own. He continued to make very popular gowns for nearly a decade more.

He attended the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris from 1908 to 1910, where his companions included George Barbier and his cousin Pierre Brissaud, as well as Monvel, Besnard, Paul Iribe and George Martin. They all became famous illustrators later on, all of whom you will find in our illustrators section. \n In 1909 Georges married a girl named Gabrielle Lauzanne. The same year he met Paul Poiret. \n In 1909, he began working for Paul Poiret and in 1911 he illustrated Poiret's famous brochure, Les Choses de Paul Poiret\". In 1912, he moved to Jean Patou, to illustrate his collections. He also started illustrating for the Paris fashion magazine Gazette du Bon Ton published by Lucien Vogel. Georges remained working for Vogel till 1925. \n   Lepape also worked freelance for many magazines including the Gazette du Bon Ton, Femina, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Les Feuillets d'Art. In 1916 Conde Nast, the American publisher of Vogue, commisioned him to do the first cover for their UK edition. After seeing his work, and publishing some of it in US Vogue also, Nast went to Paris around 1920 and brought over to Vogue a group of artists who had been contributing to the Gazette du Bon Ton, a magazine which he had taken over from Vogel. Lepape was one of these. In 1922 Vogue did a spread showing the exploits of 6 Parisiennes, the illustrations for which Nast spread out to 6 of his illustrators. Lepape was given a gay, romantic, hedonistic girl named Francoise with only her white elephant charm for a pet. Lepape sets off this story with a splash of rich and subtle colour, and shows his Francoise resplendent in her box at the opera in Cheruit's low-necked gown. Conde Nast was quick to give Lepape the prominence of the Vogue cover. Lepape was one of the dominant presences at Vogue till the mid-30's. In the book \"Fashion Drawing in Vogue\" it is mentioned \"Georges Lepape, star designer of Vogue covers throughout the 20's, ever as delicate, witty and stylish as he was inventive, did surprisingly little illustration inside the magazine.

{"designer_name":"Georges Rech","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/georges-rech\/"],"biography":"Georges Rech started his luxury French fashion house in 1960. It now has outlets in London, Paris, Dusseldorf, Montreal, Moscow, Kuala Lumpur, Hong King, Taipei and many other cities. \n The Unanyme junior line, combining knitwear with woven and tailored pieces was premiered in 1981, emphasizing lower-priced compatible separates that could be freely mixed and matched. The next expansion was into a line of accessories, and then came the establishment of Georges Rech Homme, creating for men the clean-cut yet stylish look for which Rech's womenswear had become known. The fourth arm of the house remained the high-end Georges Rech designer line offering structured sophisticated coats, suits, and dresses for women, with a timeless style independent of ephemeral fashion trends. Though each group had a separate identity, the pieces designed for each division continued to embody the basic Rech philosophy of creativity mitigated by realism and wearability. \n The company was bought out in 1989 by Courtaulds Textiles of London, and Georges Rech relinquished his personal interest in the house. Since then Daniele Jagot, who worked for the company for over 20 years, took over designing the Georges Rech top-range label, while Fumihiko Harada designed the Synonyme line. By the mid-1990s the label had little flash and sales were far from robust, in part due to a depressed market. The brand made a comeback in 1996 when designer clothing sales rallied in Europe and stayed in the black for several years, prompting expansion. The Georges Rech name became more prevalent in France, with 40 stores in the country (more than a dozen new outlets opened in 1998 alone), the same year parent company Courtauld bought Claremont Garments to augment its apparel division. \n   By the new century Courtauld was locked in battle with the U.S.-based Sara Lee Corporation over a hostile takeover attempt. To bolster its funds, Courtauld sold several units and put Georges Rech up for sale as well. Despite its efforts, however, Courtauld succumbed and became part of Sara Lee's Branded Apparel Group, which consisted of a slew of apparel, undergarment, and hosiery companies worldwide. Given the similarities in the two firm's business segments, industry analysts believed the acquisition was a good fit for both sides. The Georges Rech brand for women in 2001 remained feminine and beautiful, still designed by the founder's one-time assistant Jagot. Covering the label's growing success in the the Far East. Since 1990 the CEO has been Jean-jacques Wegnez. In 2000 the Swiss group of Leman acquired the Company, and in 2001 Rech International acquired the Paris house of Guy Laroche. George Rech boutiques number about 90 in Europe. They also have boutiques in several cities in Australia and New Zealand. Britain has about 15 boutiques in various cities. Their latest line is called Synonyme.","the_look":"They make very chic, elegant dresses and suits, beachwear, and clothes that work around the clock. They are very French.\nHis fashion house aimed to create a synthesis of ideas, designing not for any one woman or type of person, but for an ever-changing, contemporary ideal. His simple, relaxed, well-made, and affordable coats, suits, dresses, and separates projected an easy-going accessibility, without compromising on creativity or style, and his name became synonymous with casual chic. \nRech first emerged in the 1960s as one of the pioneers of Parisian ready-to-wear for women. He became known as a leading French manufacturer of tailored coats and suits, before branching out into raincoats. The early coat and suit collections were rather structured and masculine in feeling, but into the 1970s his styles broadened and loosened, with easy jackets over trousers, bloused windbreakers, billowing dresses, and both short and long skirts. Rech was interested in bringing the comfort of leisure wear and sportswear into focus at a time when the fashion majority still upheld notions of clothing propriety, whether it was dressing for city\/country, or day\/evening. He looked to the youth movements of his day for inspiration, noticing how the young defied adult conventions in their clothing, and he began to experiment with work and leisure fabrics for daytime. He declared denim was the \"perfect\" fabric, and transformed the humble, working class cloth into several sophisticated and urbane looks, such as a short, black-and-white striped denim pantsuit with witty elbow patches.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Georges Rech"]}

He is also true to the tradition of maintaining the 'house' style. He never learned to cut fabric, so he works from precise drawings and making amendments straight into the toiles. His style is one of conservative elegant beauty. \nBefore the age of 30, G\u00e9rard Pipart had become the most vital women's ready-to-wear designer in Paris. His clothes were already great sellers abroad. He made his mark with snappy, colorful sportswear, well-tailored, detailed, and with a deceptively casual simplicity that only good seams and a fine cut can guarantee. He became known for his inspired use of fabrics, as he skillfully manipulated every material he chose into amusing, wearable chic. \nHis couture collections have included elegant daytime wear, sumptuous coats, extravagant evening looks, furs, and bridal wear. Early collections focused on supple lines and a fit close to the body without being overly confining, and his clothes were praised as \"never, never too haute.\" Later collections investigated the long, languid lines of the bias-cut dress, played with loose, theatrical capes, feminized the culotte for daytime wear, and toyed with 1940s and 1950s retro looks.\nHis penchant for no-holds-barred glamor can be seen in evening dresses of frothy chiffon and bright, opulent taffeta, long-waisted and cinched, with high trumpet sleeves and luxuriant folds billowing to the floor, or exquisite embroideries requiring hundreds of hours of work. He dared to defy the \"bride wore white\" norm with his design for a Proven\u00e7al-printed, multicolored m\u00e9lange of a bridal dress, wrapped at the waist with a wide cummerbund, topped with a short jacket splashed with rhinestones. Fur trim, feathered hats, ruffles, lace, long gloves\u2014Pipart has never shied away from a certain feminine, Parisian elegance in his designs and use of accessories.\nHis 1990s collections included bright, crisp cruise wear, including short skirts and swimsuits with matching floor-length skirts in shades of hot orange, fuschia, and kelly green. Fabrics ranged from cotton pique and satin to embroidered linen and cotton jersey, affording comfortable and cheerful warm-weather looks. Other collections have highlighted pleats, with pastel skirts under pleated safari jackets for day and long iridescent taffeta dresses for evening.

Having lived in Algeria, Zaire, Gabon, Germany and France, Rosier feels that he is in an ideal position to reinterpret Kenzo's vision of global unity. \n   One of his recent collections for Kenzo featured classical Japanese details and techniques that evoked an historical mood but looked thoroughly modern. For Spring\/Summer 2002, Rosier sent out a thoroughly modern collection full of relaxed, stylish pieces. He said \"I wanted the clothes to be like white paper, being free and discreet at the same time.\" He cleverly used accessories and fastenings to transform what could have been a straightforward dull collection into a study in deconstruction. One focal point of the collection was a canvas army belt which Rosier used to pleat skirts, hold a jacket in place, or hold a scarf on a scantily dressed model. Whether weaving in and out of soft-shouldered dresses, or around the waist, this belt gave the loose clothing a hard center. Rosier presented the Kenzo Spring\/Summer 2003 during the Paris Fashion Week in October 2002. However after this collection, he was replaced at Kenzo by Antonio Marras, the Italian designer.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Germaine Emilie Krebs","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/germaine-emilie-krebs\/"],"biography":"Madame Gres was haute couture's sphinx, an austere and dignified person who dedicated her whole life to perfecting the art of draping and pleating vast amounts of cloth into a single gown. She defied the vulgarity of fashion and hated the glare of publicity. She was a genius who was admired by everyone in the fashion industry but died in obscurity and poverty. \n Germaine Emilie Krebs was born in 1903 in Paris, France. Frustrated in her ambition to become a sculptor, she began her career by making Toiles for major Paris fashion houses. She worked for a time for the house of Premet. \n In 1934, she opened her own house under the name of Alix Barton, and her gowns started to appear in fashion magazines under the name ALIX. She started experimenting with simple clothing, particularly jersey day dresses. Initially she was in partnership, and she decided to leave Alix, as the name belonged to someone else. \n   During the 30's, the Alix gowns were greatly admired. Her training in sculpture enabled her to capture the classical Greek style and timeless elegance in her evening gowns. Hers was an individual uncompromising style which seemed to have a liquid effect on the drapery and turned fashionable women into living statues. She formed a new salon GRES, taking the letters of the name from the name of her husband Russian painter Serge Czerefkov, whom she had married in 1939. After a few years, he left her and her baby daughter and went to Tahiti, never to return. She was heartbroken but she financed him until his death in 1970 although she never saw him again. The house of Gres opened in 1942 at l, rue de la Paix, during the German occupation of Paris. In spite of her being Jewish, the Germans initially allowed her to continue her business hoping that she would dress the wives of German officers. When she refused to do so, they closed her down. The salon reopened after the war and Madame Gres was again feted as a master couturier. She insisted on haute couture in a age of mass production. Her gowns often took 300 working hours to complete. They were constructed pleat by pleat, each pleat l millimeter wide. She said \"My only desire is to create dresses that impress the world\", however this led to severe financial problems. She continued making her dresses throughout the 50's, 60's and 70's. She often visited the Museum of Fine Arts, studying the classical Greek statues and returning to her atelier to create her own forms of classical gowns. She would sometimes use up to 70 metres of silk jersey. She brought out her first Perfume Cabochard in 1959. She gave out a licensing agreement for scarves and neckties, and designed jewellery for Cartier. She was awarded the Golden Thimble, fashion's highest award in 1976. However in 1982, to keep her couture going, she rashly sold her Perfume rights to Beecham. Eventually, very reluctantly she was forced to make ready-to-wear garments. Losing her work destroyed Madame Gres, without her work she had nothing to live for. In 1993, she died in poverty in an old people's sanatorium. Her daughter did not inform the world, as she herself was very poor. However when the news did come out, the French fashion industry was shocked and shamed. She had been President of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Haute Couture's governing body and she was the oldest living Couturier, a French legend, who had been allowed to disappear and to die unrecognized. In 1994, the Metropolitan Museum in New York, held a major retrospective of the work of Madame Alix Gres, which was attended by thousands of people. But of course this was too late to help the great designer herself. A large Japanese fashion distributor Yagi Tsusho, bought the name Madame Gres in 1988 and has developed the brand in Japan. Designer Lloyd Klein was chief designer in Paris from 1994-1997. The house of Gres continued under designer Frederic Molenac who joined the house of Gres in 1995. In the summer of 2002, Japanese designer Koji Tatsuno took over. Tatsuno is very respectful of the legacy of Madame Gres, and intends to continue her draping style using new and modern techniques and retaining the beauty and elegance of the House.","the_look":"Gr\u00e9s' draped and pleated silk jerseys flattered the body with the minimalist and rationalist radicalism of 1930s design, but provided a classical serenity as well. The real achievement of the draped dresses was not their idyllic evocation, but their integrity. They were a unified construction, composed of joined fabric panels continuously top to bottom, fullest in the swirling flutes of the skirt, tucked at the waist, elegantly pinched through the bodice, and surmounted at the neckline\u2014 often one-shouldered\u2014with the same materials resolved into three-dimensional twists. Gr\u00e9s was creating no mere lookalike to classical statuary, but a characteristically modern enterprise to impart the body within clothing.\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, Gr\u00e9s was translating the planarity of regional costume into a simplified origami of flat planes, ingeniously manipulated on the body to achieve a minimalism akin to sportswear. Ironically, she who exemplified the persistence of couture treated the great dress with the modernist lightness of sportswear, and she who held out so long against ready-to-wear turned with a convert's passion to its possibilities in the 1980s, when she was in her late 80s. The personalizing finesse of a plait or wrap to close or shape a garment was as characteristic of Gr\u00e9s as of Halston or McCardell; her ergodynamics brought fullness to the chest simply by canting sleeves backward so the wearer inevitably created a swelling fullness in the front as arms forced the sleeves forward, creating a pouch of air at the chest.\nFor evening, Gr\u00e9s practiced a continuous antithesis of body disclosure and hiding the body within cloth. Even the Grecian \"slave\" dress, as some of the clients called it, seemed to be as bare as possible with alarming apertures to flesh. But the Gr\u00e9s draped dress, despite its fluid exterior, was securely corseted and structured within, allowing for apertures of skins to seem revealing while at the same time giving the wearer the assurance that the dress would not shift on the body. Conversely, more or less unstructured caftans, clinging geometries of cloth, could cover the wearer so completely as to resemble dress of the Islamic world, but in these instances the softness of structure complemented the apparent suppleness.\nNever was a Gr\u00e9s garment, whether revealing or concealing, less than enchanting. The slight asymmetry of a wrap determined by one dart, the fall of a suit button to a seaming line, or the wrap of a draped dress to a torque of shaping through the torso, was an invention and an enchantment in Gr\u00e9s' inventive sculptural vocabulary. History, most notably through photographers such as Hoyningen-Heun\u00e9 and Willy Maywald, recorded the sensuous skills of Madame Gr\u00e9s chiefly in memorable black-and-white images, but the truth of her achievement came in garden and painterly colors of aubergine, magenta, cerise, and royal blue, along with a spectrum of fertile browns. Her draped Grecian slaves and goddesses were often in a white of neoclassicism, but an optical white that tended, with exposure to light, to yellow over time. Gr\u00e9s' streamlined architecture of clothing was the pure white of dreaming, of languorous physical beauty, and apparel perfect in comfort and image.","who_wears_it":["She did not design for the glitterati","but for rich women who conducted truly private lives.

{"designer_name":"Georg Arthurjensen","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/georg-arthurjensen\/"],"biography":"Georg Arthur Jensen was a Danish silversmith. \n Georg Jensen was born on August 31, 1866 (the seventh of eight children) in Radvaad, Denmark, a cluster of homes around a factory north of Copenhagen in a lovely countryside. The location of Jensen's birth and early childhood was an important factor in his lifelong work which always reflected natural forms and themes from nature. \n Jensen came from humble beginnings. His father was a grinder who worked in the knife factory in Radvad, these days the deer park, Dyrehaven north of Copenhagen. His mother was a housemaid and the daughter of a travelling locksmith. Jensen worked with his father at the factory from an early age and had little schooling. He was always creating things as a child and his family recognized and tried to encourage his artistic instincts. When he was 14 the family moved to Copenhagen so he could be apprenticed to a goldsmith. Apprentices worked long hours in those days and on Sundays he attended a technical school for additional training. What little spare time he had he spent modelling clay. His desire seems to have always been to become a sculptor. \n   From childhood, Jensen had longed to be a sculptor and he now pursued this course of study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. He graduated in 1892 and began exhibiting his work. Although his clay sculpture was well received, making a living as a fine artist proved difficult and he turned his hand to the applied arts. First as a modeller at the Bing & Grondahl porcelain factory and, beginning in 1898, with a small pottery workshop he founded in partnership with Christian Petersen. Again the work was well received, but sales were not strong enough to support Jensen, by this point a widower, and his two small sons. In 1901, he abandoned ceramics and began again as a silversmith and designer with the master, Mogens Ballin. This led Jensen to make a landmark decision, when in 1904, he risked what small capital he had and opened his own little silversmithy at 36 Bredgade in Copenhagen. Jensen's training in metalsmithing along with his education in the fine arts allowed him to combine the two disciplines and revive the tradition of the artist craftsman. Soon, the beauty and fine quality of his Art Nouveau creations caught the eye of the public and his success was assured. The Copenhagen quarters were greatly expanded and before the close of the 1920s, Jensen had opened retail outlets as far ranging as New York, London, Paris, Stockholm, and Berlin. Georg Jensen died in 1935 in Copenhagen, but in the preceding years he imbued the firm with his strongly held ideals concerning both artistry in design and excellence in craftmanship, this tradition has been adhered to throughout the twentieth century. Although Jensen himself was a proponent of the Art Nouveau style, he had the wisdom and foresight to allow his designers their own freedom of expression which expanded the stylistic scope of what the firm produced and allowed it to keep step with time","the_look":"Georg Jensen always claimed that from his early childhood, Nature was his greatest inspiration.

Deacon is the youngest child of David, an agricultural salesman and Judith, a housewife. He attended Barnard Castle School in County Durham and he initially wanted to become a marine biologist, but he failed his chemistry A-level. Deacon later joined Harrogate College of Arts, where he completed an art foundation course. After completing his course he went on to study at Central St Martins and was in the same class as fashion designers Alexander McQueen and Luella Bartley. He graduated in 1992 and began collaborating on the label 'Doran Deacon' with his friend, Fi Doran as well as contributing illustrations to Dazed & Confused. \n Deacon choose to travel and gain experiences at fashion houses, before starting his own label. During his time in Paris, Deacon was hired to work with fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, where he learnt how to use a brand name commercially. Deacon worked with Castelbajac for two years, before returning to London to work for High Street fashion houses. During this time, Deacon met the owner of Italian luxury goods house, Bottega Veneta, and was hired to work for the company, becoming the head designer and debuting a much acclaimed collection in 2000. Deacon was dismissed in 2001 when the Gucci group bought the company and terminated his contract, so they could hire German designer, Tomas Maier. However, he was immediately hired by Tom Ford to assist with Gucci womenswear. Deacon was forced to leave Gucci after one season when he became ill from an infected saliva gland. \n   Once he had recovered, Deacon decided to take out a loan to start his own label and he launched GILES in 2003. He launched his first collection at London Fashion Week in February 2004, styled by his friend Katie Grand, the show saw models Karen Elson, Lily Cole, Eva Herzigova and Linda Evangelista walking the catwalk. The collection received international acclaim and began a renewed interest in London fashion. In April 2010, it was announced that Deacon had been appointed the creative director position with French fashion house Ungaro, following the dismissal of Estrella Archs. Deacon is the fifth designer to be hired by the house since it was sold to entrepreneur Asim Abdullah in 2005. He will show his first collection for Ungaro in October 2010. Deacon has worked on many collaborations with companies including Sky, Converse and Evoke, with whom he created his first jewellery collection. Deacon has called collaborations \"practical\", because they \"bring the money you need for your own company\". In a two season collaboration with British fashion company Mulberry, Deacon introduced a line of accessories called \"Mulberry for Giles\", which was both a commercial and critical success. Deacon was then appointed to design for the classic British tailoring label, Daks. He showed his first and second collections for the brand in 2007 and his third in 2008. In 2009, Deacon designed and created a strapless dress with polka dots for the Cadbury's Caramel Bunny, to celebrate the launch of Caramel Nibbles.

In the same year, Deacon teamed up with Norwegian water company Isklar and created a limited edition Tote bag with 50 per cent of the proceeds from each bag sold going to Oxfam. Deacon's best known collaboration has been with the High Street fashion chain New Look. The collection called Gold by Giles began in March 2007. Actress Drew Barrymore starred in the first ad campaigns for the collection, following a chance meeting between her and the designer in a lift. British model, Agyness Deyn took over and modelled the key pieces for Deacon's 4th collection.

The character was embellished on many of the dresses and the models wore oversized helmets in the shape of Pac-Man. Deacon's New Look menswear collections have been described by GQ magazine as \"straddling the line between quirky and wearable\". \nOn Deacon's style, fashion website Style.com has said, \"His work is randomness incarnate.

{"designer_name":"Giuseppe Lancetti","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/giuseppe-lancetti\/"],"biography":"Giuseppe Lancetti, known as Pino Lancetti  was one of the most prestigious creators of high fashion in Europe, and creator of the Lancetti bran. \n Pino Lancetti began his career in high Roman fashion in the 1950s, when it was designed by artists, made by craftspeople and worn by a minute coterie of the grand; by the time he departed from couture in 2001, his name was a brand and fashion was a major Italian export industry. \n Lancetti's first and last interest was painting; he was called the artist couturier. He was born in the Perugian town of Gualdo Tadino, famous for its ceramics, and intended to work in that business after studying at the art institute in the city of Perugia. But as a student he also had a quiet and serious gift for clothes, which he used when he moved to Rome in 1954. He set up a small atelier, sold freelance sketches to the salons of the Fontana sisters and Contessa Simonetti Visconti, and designed for the house of Carosa. \n   Italian fashion had first been exhibited internationally in the early 1950s through shows in Florence, organised as an extension of the local arts and crafts heritage. But by the end of the decade, Rome had become the dolce vita city - and a destination for the jet set and American department store buyers on the hunt for non-Parisian glamour. The Roman couture houses, the alta moda, decided to stage their own shows. Lancetti opened his House in Rome in 1961. He put on a collection in the Pitti palace in Florence, with the enthusiastic endorsement of senior fashion editor Irene Brin and the director of Rome's Modern Art Gallery, Palma Bucarelli. Then, for more than a decade, he joined Fabiani, Capucci, Mila Schon and Valentino in the Rome shows. He stopped showing regularly as the alta moda season disintegrated in the 1970s - and later admitted, of the catwalk shows of the 1990s, that the cost and melodrama of supermodel display were not always balanced by income from sales. When he realised in 1963 that women wanted fewer formal clothes, Lancetti \"put away the crinolines\" and produced a successful collection based on military details, albeit rendered in supersoft stuffs and leathers. He never did take to the subsequent era of T-shirt and jeans. He was not approving of extreme youth, either. Girls lacked elegance, he used to say. Pino Lancetti is the only designer who in recent years has brought the most famous models in the world to present his collections: from Naomi Campbell to Carla Bruni, from Yasmeet Gauri to Karen Mulder, from Kate Moss to Veronica Webb. For the moment this activity has been abandoned, considering the high cost and disorganizzation of the semi-annual collections. Lancetti restructured his company in the 1990s; those golden hands responsible for craftwork were getting harder to find and keep in Italy. He made licensing deals and set up new labels for, among other items, cashmere knits and bridal dresses. The Alta Moda gave him a lifetime achievement award in 2000, and he presented a final collection, elegant as ever, before selling his name and company to a Tuscan industrialist, Ugo Paci, who briefly, between 2003 and 2005, brought in the brilliant baby Brazilian Icarius de Menezes as creative director. His prints were almost up to the master's standard, although the master was by then painting quietly in retirement till his dead in March 2007. Pino Lancetti was murdered in Roma on 8 March 2007, at the age of 78. Lancetti is survived by his sisters, Edda, Nanda and Lorena.","the_look":"Lancetti designed memorable textiles based on the paintings of major artists (his own favourites were Kandinsky, Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse and the designer-abstract painter Sonia Delaunay); with them, he temporarily challenged, in the 1960s, Emilio Pucci's dominance of Italian prints. His work was especially venerated in Japan.\nArt influenced his cut and construction, too - themes from great gallery shows, which he visited repeatedly, turned up in his work to the end of his career. He also borrowed from oriental and folk decoration, and from movies.","who_wears_it":["Ginger Rogers","Audrey Hepburn","Annie Girardot","la principessa Salimah Aga Khan","Soraya Esfandiary Bakhtiari","Paola Ruffo di Calabria"],"perfumes":["1985 Lancetti Homme (M)","1985 Via Condotti Pour Femme (W)","1993 Suspense (W)","1995 Madame (W)","2001 Lancetti Femme (W)","2002 Etre Homme (M)","2002 Etre Femme (W)","2004 Etre Special Edition (W)","2004 Etre Special Edition II (W)","2005 Etre Special Edition III (W)","2005 Etre Special Edition IV (W)","2006 Lancetti Mood Man (M)","2006 Lancetti Mood Woman (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Lancetti"]}

Pugh had only four weeks, with no studio, no assistants, and little money, to create the collection.

{"designer_name":"Hussein Chalayan","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/hussein-chalayan\/"],"biography":"  Hussein Chalayan is a Turkish Cypriot, born in 1970. His name was originally Huseyin Caglayan but he changed it to Chalayan. He was an only child, his parent separated, his mother remaining in Cyprus and his father going to London. Hussein joined him there in 1982 when he was 12 years old. His father, whose name is Ata, has since remarried. \n Chalayan did not consider designing clothes initially; he wanted to be a pilot or an architect. He very nearly studied architecture but changed his mind at the last minute and joined St. Martins School of Art, London. His degree show in 1993, was received with elation \n   It was displayed in the windows, by Browns, the store which has started so many young designers including John Galliano. His collection was made with fabric which he had buried in the garden with steel filings to give an aged look. He had tried to put magnets on the catwalk to pull out steel rods in the garments, but it didn't work. Even though it was a radical design, the collection had commercial pieces which sold immediately. In 1994, he presented his first solo collection. In 1995, he used illuminated airport in-flight path patterns on his garments. In the same year he topped 100 rivals to win a contest organized by Absolut Vodka, who backed him financially for London Fashion Week. In 1997, he used extensive beading executed with mathematical precision, on his dresses. The eveningwear was in the form of column dresses in fine matt jersey, decorated with jet beads, gold embroidery and gold chains. In 1998, Chalayan was honoured with the Designer of the Year award at the annual British Fashion Awards. He is admired by all the leading avant-garde designers. Rei Kawakubo says \"I like his attitude and way of thinking.\" Alexander McQueen says \"I admire his challenging mind.\" Chalayan has displayed an uncanny ability to present spot-on collections season after season. Some collections shock people, such as his \"Between\" collection of 1998. He presented traditional Muslim garb combined with half-naked models parading down the catwalk. Chalayan has developed a reputation for being a serious man of ideas, who avoids fashions social circuit like the plague. His work is highly individual, he avoids borrowing from fashion history as so many designers do. For several seasons he cut clothes without armholes or sleeves, binding the arms close to the body but he says \"I just did it for the shows, I don't expect people to actually wear them like that.\" In addition to his own label, he also designed for 3 years for TSE in New York, and has created a new outlet TOP SHOP in London. In 2000, he was voted British Fashion Designer of the year. However financial troubles came in his way in 2001 and he had to close down his company for several months. He became Creative Director of Asprey, Britain's venerable lifestyle brand. However in December 2001 he has entered into partnership with Gibo Co. Spa, who has become the worldwide licensee for his ready-to-wear label. Chalayan is currently showing in Paris, not London. Asprey had not tackled womenswear since the 1920's but appointed Hussein Chalayan in 2000 to create ready-to-wear. Britain's hottest new beauty, Keira Knightly, has been Asprey's new \"face\". Chalayan said \"I want to make luxury clothing ultra-functional, in keeping with British tradition, but timeless and appealing to anyone who really loves design.\" However, after completing four years, Hussein has now left Asprey to concentrate on his own label exclusively. In August 2004, Chalayan announced he is launching a new line. He opened his first store in Tokyo in April 2004 which is going well. He is now expanding his women's line to sell at 40% lower prices than his signature collection. Gibo, the Italian firm, will produce the new line as well as Chalayan's main line. Franco Pene, chairman of Gibo said \"this is a very commercial collection, where the designer can freely express his creativity, and reach a new younger market.\" He can experiment with ideas which may be a bit radical for his more expensive line. A passionate fashion designer, Chalayan has made his feelings for celebrity-based fashion clear when he publicly announced how he felt about Kate Moss's collaboration with high-street clothing label Top Shop, calling the move \"insulting\". Collaborations do not stop with art and fashion for the designer, who is also a philanthropist. In 2007, he donated a showpiece to the Fashion is Art exhibition in aid of radio station Capital 95.8's Help a London Child charity which was sold at an exclusive auction in London. In early 2008, he designed a series of laser LED dresses in collaboration with luxury label Swarovski, showcased in Tokyo. 28th February 2008, Chalayan was appointed as the creative director for German sportswear label Puma. Puma have also announced that they have purchased a majority stake in his label. The designer also collaborated with German hoisery and legwear label Flake to produce one-off footwear pieces for his Autumn\/Winter 2008 collection show cased in Paris","the_look":"His clothes are minimal in look, maximal in thought. His work challenges what you can do with a length of fabric. He rethinks the body and challenges the concept of zones of the body. He tries never to make his clothes sexy. He does not want them to be attractive in that obvious way. He uses a lean sinuous silhouette, great attention to detail and fabrics liked felted wools, double-faced cashmere, and matt jersey. There is often a darkness to his themes, vampires, tombs and constriction have all featured in his collections. However, overall his clothes are innovative, exquisite and technically brilliant.

{"designer_name":"Helmut Lang","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/helmut-lang\/"],"biography":"  Helmut Lang is an Austrian fashion designer born in March 10, 1956 in Vienna known for his minimalist, deconstructive, and often severe designs. His parents divorced when he was 3 years old and he lived with his grandfather, a shoemaker, in the mountains behind Salzburg. \n When he was 21, he had a fruitless search for perfectly made T-shirts and jackets. So he decided to design and make his own. Originally, Lang studied business, but switched over to fashion and opened his first studio in 1977. \n   He specialized in avant-garde clothing which disregarded convention. A 'deconstructionist', Lang works in an essentially urban style. He blends cheap and expensive fabrics and blurs the lines between traditional men\u2019s wear and women\u2019s wear. His clothes were fairly successful in his native Austria, and he branched out to Paris in 1986. At the time in the late 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s, minimalist fashion was at its height, with Jil Sander, Giorgio Armani, and Helmut Lang himself being very popular and successful. In 1998, he moved to New York. His 1998 collection was shown over the internet instead of physically. the label In 1999 Lang entered into collaboration with Prada to open boutiques all over Europe and expand his line. He is now poised to become a major global marketing force, with a Jeans line, a perfume deal with Proctor and Gamble and a leather license in the pipeline. Prada had acquired 51% of Helmut Lang's company in August 1999, and in September 2004, they took complete control by buying out the remaining 49%. It was announced that Helmut will continue as creative director of the company designing the clothes. Financial details were not disclosed. In a surprise announcement in January 2005, the Prada Group who own Helmet Lang's company, informed of his departure from his own company. He has been considered a by-word for cool in recent years, and it appears his ideas for running his company were at odds with the Prada management just as Jil Sander's were when she left her own company recently. In March Prada announced that they would close the Helmut Lang showroom in New York. However Helmut is not yet down. He is talking to several major companies about the future. After Mr. Lang's departure, Prada unsuccessfully tried to continue the collections with an in-house design team. In March 2005, Prada closed down the label's headquarters in SoHo, New York. In September 2005, Prada announced that production of the lines had been halted. By the end of 2005, all that existed of the brand was its name: the design atelier had been closed, the collections had been discontinued and all of the art-inspired Helmut Lang stores had been shut down (with the exception of the Paris location, to sell remaining stock). The corporate web site, which formerly displayed pictures of the collections, remained online, but the contents could no longer be seen. On March 17, 2006, Prada Group announced that, after six loss-making years, Link Theory Holdings (LTH) of Tokyo would be acquiring the Helmut Lang brand for an estimated \u20ac20 million. This came about three weeks after Prada had sold the Jil Sander label to British equity firm Change Capital Partners (CCP). Already in spring 2005, it had been rumored that Prada was trying to sell the label. Prada Group was said to want to concentrate on its core labels, Prada and Miu Miu, again. The Japanese holding company LTH, developer of the theory fashion label in Japan and the US, re-launched the Helmut Lang collections under the direction of a \"suitable\" designer for the spring\/summer 2007 season (presented in fall 2006), in select boutiques worldwide as a \u201ccontemporary brand\".The new label was said to be based out of New York City. LTH also owns profitable German fashion house Rosner, which it bought in late October 2005, as well as the Joie, PLS+T and Kulson labels. Rumor had it for a while that Russian-born designer Alexandre Plokhov of menswear label Cloak, a former men's pattern maker for fashion house Marc Jacobs, and winner of the 2005 Swarovski's Perry Ellis Award for Emerging Talent Menswear, might be the new designer for Helmut Lang. It was never, though, expected that Lang himself would return to the label that bears his name, although Chikara Sasake, president and chief executive of LTH, gave to understand that if Lang \u201cwants to come back, the door is always open\u201d. In May 2006, it was announced that Michael and Nicole Colovos, an American-New Zealand designer couple, who formerly had their own Los Angeles-based denim label Habitual, had been installed by Link Theory as creative directors for the new Helmut Lang brand. From February 2007, select upscale retailers such as Barneys or Bergdorf Goodman carry the spring\/summer 2007 Helmut Lang contemporary sportswear collection. The design office has been set up in West Chelsea in New York. The collection, described as \"a commercial reduction of [Mr. Lang's] fashion identity\",has received quite favorable reviews even though it is clearly not seen as a continuation of the original line. The item prices in the collection are about 20% above those for comparable Link Theory items and, hence, below the original Helmut Lang prices. Link Theory expects to generate US$ 8 million in revenues in 2008, and make a profit in 2009 with the label.The company also announced that \"over the long term\" they intend \"to also establish exclusive Helmut Lang shops\" in the US, Europe and Japan. The Helmut Lang web site was re-activated at the end of 2006 and was fully launched in spring 2007. Lang, who now resides on Long Island of independent means, is said not to be involved in the re-launch in any way All of the original, art-inspired signature Helmut Lang stores that existed in Vienna, Munich, Milan, Paris, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo, as well as several stores-in-store in the Asian market, that existed between 1995 and 2005 have been closed. The last one to close was the Paris location in 2005 to sell remaining stock. In March 2007, Link Theory opened the first post-Prada signature Helmut Lang store in Tokyo's fashionable Aoyama district. In Japan, the company has since then installed several Helmut Lang stores-in-store at local department stores. In August 2007, a new freestanding Helmut Lang store was opened on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. It is, after the Tokyo store, the second signature Helmut Lang store since the closing of the last original store in Paris. The store, in close proximity to Melrose Place, is adjacent to an existing theory store at 8424 Melrose Avenue. Another Helmut Lang store opened on September 28, 2007 on Maiden Lane in San Francisco, in the building previously occupied by Jil Sander. In New York City, a temporary 'pop-up shop' opened in mid-December 2007, while the company is apparently looking for a larger location in the Meatpacking District.","the_look":"The name Helmut Lang has become synonymous with the cerebral brand of minimalism that took the fashion world by storm in the late eighties. Lang's razor-sharp lines and high-tech fabrics are made for only the most disciplined of bodies - even his signature t-shirts, which elevated the clingy tee to couture status, are famously unforgiving (and famously expensive). He has a stark sober palette, often slashed with bright colour, which reflects a modern, even futuristic perspective. His cleverly thought out clothes are cleanly and precisely tailored, but in an exploratory, quirky manner. His fabric combinations reveal a forward-looking approach.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["2000 Helmut Lang (W)","2000 Helmut Lang (M)","2001 Velviona(W)","2002 Cuiron (M)"],"social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/helmutlang","brands":["Helmut Lang"]}

{"designer_name":"Hubert Degivenchy","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/hubert-degivenchy\/"],"biography":"  Hubert James Taffin de Givenchy was born in 1927 in Beauvais, France. His father died when he was young, and he was brought up by his grandfather, an artist and expert tapestry maker. \n Aged seventeen, inspired by his mother\u2019s glossies, prompted by his seamstress cousins and brimming with youthful exuberance, Hubert de Givenchy leaves Beauvais for Paris, at a time when the couturier business was still passed on from master to apprentice. \n   In 1945 he begins his apprenticeship as a draughtsman for the couturier Jacques Fath while studying at the Ecole de Beaus Arts. After a year, he joined Robert Piguet and then Lucien Lelong. In 1950 he joined Elsa Schiaparelli where his bright youthful separates enchanted her clientele. After four years of collaboration, Hubert de Givenchy resigns from Schiaparelli, intent on opening his own couture house 1951. The somewhat overbearing couturiere thunderously dismisses him as \u00abyet another bankruptcy\u00bb. Hubert de Givenchy opens his own maison at n\u00b0 8, rue Alfred de Vigny, overlooking Paris\u2019s Parc Monceau. Foreseeing relaxed chic and the democratisation of luxury, which together marked the end of the century, in 1952 Givenchy launched \u00abseparates\u00bb, light skirts and puff-sleeved blouses made from raw cotton \u2013 previously reserved for fittings only. Two years later Hubert de Givenchy was the first major fashion designer to present a luxury ready-to-wear line, \u00abGivenchy Universit\u00e9\u00bb. More than any other, this was a designer who maintained close relations with his famous clients. In 1953 one of Hubert de Givenchy\u2019s designs was featured on the cover of Life magazine. In 1954 upon the death of Jacques Fath, French entrepreneur Jean Prouvost asks Hubert de Givenchy to develop the first collection of high-end women\u2019s ready-to-wear to be designed by a couturier. \u00abJacques Fath Universit\u00e9\u00bb thus becomes \u00abGivenchy Universit\u00e9\u00bb. The line is manufactured in Paris\u2019s 10th arrondissement garment district on industrial sewing machines imported from the United States. Givenchy introduced his perfume L'Interdit in January 1957 but allowed only Audrey to use it for a whole year, only allowing it into the market in December. He designed clothes for her films \"Funny Face\", \"Breakfast at Tiffanys\" and others. He designed clothes for a total of 10 films in all. Balenciaga had long been an idol to Givenchy and in 1953 he actually met him. They became friends and Balenciaga worked with him continuously to help Givenchy mature as a couturier. Balenciaga taught him how to minimize, how to avoid unnecessary detail, how to be involved in shape and colour. Launch of the high-end ready-to-wear collection \u00abGivenchy Nouvelle Boutique\u00bb in 1968, in association with French clothing manufacturer Mendes. In 1973 Givenchy launches \u00abGentleman Givenchy\u00bb, his first men\u2019s ready-to-wear collection. The always impeccably turned-out Hubert de Givenchy, forever on the arm of the world\u2019s most iconic beauties, proves to be his new label\u2019s own best marketing tool. However in 1988, Givenchy sold his house to LVMH (Bernard Arnault), who also own the houses of Dior, Lacroix, Celine and Kenzo. Arnault pressured Hubert Givenchy hard to retire. Finally, he did so in 1995. After retiring in 1995, Hubert de Givenchy was succeeded by young British designers. On January 1st 1996, John Galliano is appointed as head designer of Givenchy\u2019s haute couture and ready-to-wear lines. On October 14th 1997, John Galliano departs for Dior and is replaced at the helm of Givenchy by fellow British Designer of the Year and enfant terrible Alexander McQueen. In 2000 the house of Givenchy brought out a new cosmetics line called \"Teint Miroir\". In 2001, Alexander McQueen left Givenchy. He departed as the ultimate professional, doing the Autumn\/Winter 2002 collection with an intimate showing of wonderful clothes that crossed Tough Chic with a youthful charm delivered with impeccable skill. It was a surprise when Bernard Arnault (chief officer of LVMH who owns Givenchy, Dior and others) appointed Julien Macdonald the British designer, as chief designer for Givenchy haute couture. His first collection was Spring 2001. MacDonald presented the Haute Couture Spring\/Summer 2002 show for Givenchy and it was a beautiful show. However soon afterwards, he announced that he would be leaving Givenchy when his contract is up in April. He has not indicated his future plans. In December 2003, the British tailor Ozwald Boateng was appointed creative director for Givenchy Homme and in March 2005 the Italian designer Riccardo Tisci was appointed creative director for the Givenchy Femme haute couture and ready-to-wear collections.","the_look":"For 43 years, Hubert de Givenchy has been the perfect gentleman of couture.

{"designer_name":"Heidemarie Jiline Sander","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/heidemarie-jiline-sander\/"],"biography":"  Her real name is Heidemarie Jiline Sander, and she was born in 1943 in Wesselburen, Germany. Jil Sander is a fashion designer known for minimalist designs and her perfume line. \n Her father was in the German army fighting on the Russian front, her mother had fled from the bombing in Hamburg. \n   She studied textile design at Krefeld School of Textiles (class of 1963) in Germany, before spending a year as an exchange student at the University of Los Angeles, California in 1963-4. She then became a journalist for McCalls magazine in the US, and German women's magazines before turning to freelance clothing design. In 1968, she opened her own boutique in Hamburg, Germany. In 1973, at the age of 24, she founded her eponymous fashion house. And showing her first collection in 1974. She also has boutiques in Paris, London, New York and many other major cities. In 1989, her company went on the Stock exchange as a public limited company. In 1999 Prada Group bought a 75% share in her company. Six months later, she left after confrontations with Prada CEO Patrizio Bertelli. The house, not surprisingly, faltered without the designer who defined it. Milan Vukmirovic, formerly of Colette boutique in Paris, and a very brief stint with Gucci, was appointed chief designer. He has not been very successful in continuing Jil Sander's vision and the garments are disappointing. The design team headed by Vukmirovic emphasised commercially viable sportswear. The Spring\/Summer 2003 collection shown in Milan in September 2002 was only sporty clothing. Vukmirovic showed the Sander house Fall collection during Milan Fashion Week in March 2003. It was not a very inspiring show. He showed kilts in tiers of pleats and asymmetric skirts or extended into dresses. One white shirt had embroidered wings on the back. He also showed T-shirts with \"wild heart\" or \"sweet angel\" on them. Prada had to inject a considerable amount of cash in early 2003 to keep Jil Sander going, amid rumours of mounting losses. There was a lot of speculation about selling the house and Jil Sander returning to the house she founded. There was some talk of her meeting with executives of Hugo Boss who might buy her company from Prada. At the end of May 2003, Jil came back as Designer for the house she had founded, with full control. She was also made a member of Prada board of Directors. It had become clear to the whole world, that money alone did not ensure success in the fashion world. Everyone recognized that the soul of a brand resides in one artistic individual. In November 2004, it was announced that Jil Sander is again leaving her company because of differences with Prada. This time it appears to be permanent. In May 2005, the house announced that Raf Simons would be the new creative director from July 1st 2005, for womens and menswear collections. His first collection for Jil Sander was for Autumn\/Winter 2006 in Milan.","the_look":"She perceived a need for understated clothes with a sense of quiet inner self-confidence, but which would provide the wearer with the ultimate in fit, quality and modernity. Her minimalist style gained popularity on the international market. She combined the simplicity of male garments with a feminine sense of luxurious fabrics. Her clothes were a byword for a ultra-modern, sensuality that was technical as well as beautiful. Jil Sander also experimented with new materials such as silver-laminated linen, which she felt to be much more subtle than straightforward silver. Her minimalist trademarks include striking silhouettes, high-end fabrics, and meticulous detail, emphasizing quality over flash. Her work descends from that of Coco Chanel, as opposed to the bleeding-edge esthetic of Lagerfeld and Gaultier or the readiness of sportswear design, as exemplified by the like of Giorgio Armani and Calvin Klein.","who_wears_it":["Jude Law","Kiera Knightley","Martha Stewart","Sigourney Weaver","Jerry Bruckheimer","Winona Ryder","Ellen Barkin","Marina Rust","Linda Evangelista","Narciso Rodriguez"],"perfumes":["1980 Jil Sander Woman","1981 Jil Sander Woman Pure","1981 Jil Sander Man Pure","1981 Jil Sander Bath and Beauty","1982 Jil Sander Man","1983 Jil Sander Woman 2","1985 Jil Sander Woman III","1988 Jil Sander Man 2","1989 Jil Sander Sun (W)","1990 Jil Sander No. 4 (W)","1991 Jil Sander Man 3","1993 Jil Sander Background (M)","1989 Jil Sander feeling man","1997 Jil (W)","1998 Jil Sander Sun Body Fragrance","2000 Jil Sander Sensations (W)","2002 Jil Sander Sun (M)","2003 Jil Sander Pure(W)","2004 Jil Sander Pure (M)","2004 Jil Sander Sport (W)","2004 Jil Sander Sport (M)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Jil Sander"]}
{"designer_name":"Hugo Boss","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/hugo-boss\/"],"biography":"  Hugo Boss founded a clothing factory in Metzingen, Germany, in 1923, only a few years after the end of WW I, while most of the county was in a state of economic ruin. Initially workers' clothes were made. \n In 1953, after 30 years, the first men's suits were made. Boss became known for high-end men\u2019s suits and enjoyed popularity in the 1980's when stars like Don Johnson and Jan-Michael Philip wore their suits. \n   Before and during WW II, Mr. Boss\u2019 company both designed and manufactured uniforms and attire for the troops, officers and other governmental braches of Nazi Germany, including the SS. It is likely that the factory used forced labour. After the war, Hugo Boss was labelled an \u201copportunist of the Third Reich\u201d and fined 80.000 marks. The company then languished in relative obscurity until the fifties. Hugo Boss himself died in 1948. the label Hugo Boss AG is a fashion house based in Germany, which specializes in menswear. The company went public in 1985 and is now part of the Marzotto Group, an Italian luxury group controlled by the Marzotto family. No member of the Boss family is part of the Hugo Boss firm now. In 1993, 70 years after its founding, Hugo Boss launched its first fragrance, and created a division which has since grown to be an important part of the company. In 1999 Boss Orange for men was launched described as sporty and casual separating itself from the trendy Hugo brand and the sophisticated Boss Black brand. Boss Green is a completely sporty brand selling items designed for sport or a sporty look. In 2000, Werner Baldessarini, the Chairman of the company, brought out a womenswear line which has been very successful. Todays brands for men include; Boss Black, Boss Green, Boss Orange, Hugo and separately Baldessarini. For women; Boss Black, Boss Orange and Hugo. Also parts of the brand are Lifestyle Accessories. The company's products, divided over three brands, are available throughout the world in 102 countries and more than 5,000 retail stores. These brands are Boss, Hugo, and since 2004, Baldessarini. The latter, Baldessarini GmbH, is a more independent business unit which focuses more on a prestigious image than its two sister brands. It sells, like the other Hugo Boss brands, clothing, shoes, fragrances and accessories. The company is presently a subsidiary held by Italian material manufacturer Marzotto S.p.A. under a new fashion company Valentino Fashion Group with 50.9% held in the Boss Group. All fragrance brands (Hugo, Hugo Boss and Baldessarini) are owned by Procter & Gamble.

{"designer_name":"Hedislimane","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/hedislimane\/"],"biography":"Hedi Slimane (born July 5, 1968 in Paris) is a French fashion designer. He studied Art History at the \u00c9cole du Louvre, and was also educated as a tailor. From 1992 to 1995 he worked for Jean-Jacques Picart, notably on the centenary exhibition of Louis Vuitton's \"LV\" monogramme label. \n After working as Collections Director for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche Homme in 1997, and subsequently as Artistic Director, he became the chief designer for men\u2019s clothing, Dior Homme, for Christian Dior in 2000. In 2002, the Council of Fashion Designers of America named him the International Designer of the Year in New York. \n In July 2007, Hedi Slimane decided to quit the house of Dior. In order to convince him to stay, LVMH proposed him to finance his own signature line. Negotiations lasted for 6 months. Slimane called them off in February. He made a statement on his website to explain his choice. Slimane did not want to lose his creative freedom, sell his name, and loose the management of his own brand. He left for US, joined his friend Gus Van Sant, and started a new project, \"Young American\", which was partly shown at FOAM museum in July 2007. He opened 2 others shows, at Arndt and Partners gallery, in Berlin, SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH (a groupshow, with contribution form the emrging Ny art scene), and a solo show at Ellipse Foundation for contemporary art. Hedi Slimane is currently working on a few upcoming exhibitions: in November at galery Almine Rech, in Paris, January 2008, in Tokyo, at Koyanagi gallery, and May 2008 at Musac Contemporary art museum in Spain. \n   He is expected to debut a line of his own which will include womenswear. Having a background in furniture design, fragrance, store design, and photography, Slimane is noted for the slim silhouette of his menswear. In addition to his work as a fashion designer, he has been involved in various other projects, including becoming editor-in-chief of Lib\u00e9ration and designing album covers for artists such as Phoenix . In 2004, he published Stage, a collection of his Rock photography. Slimane has published several other books of his photography and has contributed writing and photography to many style and fashion magazines including Vanity Fair. Slimane has many connections to the British indie-rock scene, notably his close friendship with controversial Babyshambles singer Pete Doherty. In 2004 German documentary-makers Christina Trebbi and Gero Von Boehm made a documentary about Slimane, entitled Hedi Slimane, ma vie (\"Hedi Slimane, my life\"). Slimane is widely known to use very young and thin models for his fashion shows, and claims to have recruited young models in London and Berlin who fit within his criteria. Isaac Ferry, the son of rocker Bryan Ferry, made his catwalk debut at one of Slimane's shows when he was 16 years old. Slimane was misquoted in many interviews as saying that he survives on a delicately balanced diet and prefers food that he doesn't have to chew much. The mistake came from from a mistranslation: \"baby food\", means \"comfort food\" in French. He does not drink, smoke or do drugs.","the_look":"Slimane's silhouettes are based on classic menswear but with a modern twist. He is known for preferring black (sometimes with hints of bright color); for narrow lines, low-cut and sheer shirts and thin-waisted suits; and for a certain femininity that appeals to men and women alike. After women such as actress Cate Blanchett and entertainer Madonna requested versions of his men's suits, Slimane began selling certain items for women as well, not modified at all from the men's designs except being available in smaller sizes.\nSlimane has a reputation for high-quality tailoring, attention to detail, and minimalist designs, his pieces have frequently been termed \"architectural\" and \"slightly subversive.\" He also is interested in the idea of matching, whether a tuxedo and a swimsuit or a pair of sunglasses and a ring. Although his designs appeal to youthful men\u2014 and his very young runway models emphasize this slant\u2014Slimane has commented that his clothes are much more about attitude the wearer's age.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Christian Dior","Dior Homme","Celine"]}
{"designer_name":"Herbert Gallen","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/herbert-gallen\/"],"biography":"Born in the 1920's, in 1949 Herbert Gallen started a company for womenswear and he chose the name \"Ellen Tracy\" because it sounded nice, actually Ellen Tracy doesn't exist. \n He grew up in Patterson, New Jersey, the grandson of a silk mill owner and son of a fabric manufacturer. Ironically, he never planned to become involved in the apparel industry. After graduating from high school, he went to work for an uncle who owned more than two-dozen auto supply stores. Gallen ran his own store before serving a stint in the army, and was still involved in the auto parts business during World War II. Because of wartime restrictions, fabric became difficult to acquire and he recognized a chance to take advantage of his Patterson connections to move into the apparel industry. With fabric procured from a friend, he produced several sample blouses, which he then took to the major department stores located on Manhattan's 34th Street. He visited Franklin Simon and immediately sold every blouse he had, a successful launch of a new business. For the next few years he produced plain-looking blouses, using his wife's name, Betty Barr, for a label. Along with a sales manager he opened a showroom on Third Avenue that also served as a warehouse and shipping point for the blouses he had produced in Manhattan. In 1949, with financial backing from a partner named Mike Brawer, Gallen formed a new company, which he called Ellen Tracy, a name he made up in the belief that a women's line should feature a woman's name. \n Ellen Tracy blouses sold $28.50 to $30 a dozen at wholesale to such customers as Oppenheim Collins, B. Altman, and Macy's. As the business began to grow, Gallen hired more people, moved to a larger showroom, and opened a warehouse in Hackensack, New Jersey. Manhattan production also was supplemented by contractors in Pennsylvania. It was not until the early 1960s that the company began to do some manufacturing overseas. Gallen was very much a hands-on owner, involved in all aspects of the business, earning a reputation as a perfectionist. He hired a designer to produce more attractive garments, and over the course of a dozen years went through several designers before hiring a recent college graduate named Linda Allard who over the next 40 years would be instrumental in helping him build Ellen Tracy into an important bridge label. Linda has been designing for the company since then. In 1984 her name was added to the label, it is now \"Linda Allard for Ellen Tracy.\" \n   Allard grew up on a farm in Doylestown, Ohio, her father a civil engineer and her mother a first grade teacher and 4-H Club adviser. By age ten she was designing outfits for her paper dolls. Along with her two sisters she learned to sew from their mother, who refused to accept anything less than excellent work. As a teenager she began to make her own clothes and although she knew she wanted to involve her life in some way with clothing she was simply unaware that fashion school was an option. Instead she went to Kent State University after winning a fine arts scholarship. There she was able to take a few pattern-making courses, but her art curriculum was essentially geared toward producing school teachers, which held no appeal for Allard. For a senior-year project she held her first fashion show and assembled a portfolio of photographs, revealing both a drive to succeed as well as ingenuity. To find models she approached friends, offering to make an outfit they could keep if they participated in the show, not to mention bought the fabric. She also received a glimpse of New York after winning a month-long internship with Mademoiselle in a guest editor contest. After graduating from Kent State, with $200 from her parents in her purse, Allard took the Greyhound bus to New York, checked into a women's hotel, and began to search for a job in the fashion industry. She assumed it would be a short-term career, followed by marriage and a life devoted to raising a family. With no contacts and little knowledge, she naively went door-to-door in Manhattan's garment district asking if anyone was in need of an assistant designer. No one was interested, including Ellen Tracy at first. After three weeks, with her money all but exhausted and facing the prospect of returning home, she was asked to return to Ellen Tracy to interview with Gallen. His designer at the time was Dorothy Avazian, who according to Gallen had recently angered him: \"She showed me things I didn't like, and the sales manager said there was a girl who was here earlier in the week, and we called her in.\" Allard's memory of their meeting was vivid: \"It was 2 p.m. on September 27, 1962, a fateful day. I sat across from Mr. Gallen and it happened to be a really lousy, New York, rainy, drenched day. I think he felt I was desperate for a job. He looked at my portfolio and asked, 'How much money would you like to make?' Well, I hadn't even thought about that. So I said, 'I would like to make $50 a week.' He said, 'Sorry, but if you'll take $60, you can have a job.'\" Allard became Avazian's assistant and learned the technical side of the garment industry before being allowed to try her hand at designing. After Avazian quit in 1964, Gallen asked Allard if she was interested in taking over the collection, and despite a fear of failure she accepted, becoming director of design. Ellen Tracy at this point was still devoted to the business of producing quality blouses, as well as shirtwaist dresses. It was also a time when women's work attire was a suit, hat, gloves, and high heels, but the 1960s, a decade that produced a wide range of social changes, would soon see a more youthful, casual approach to fashion, one that a young designer like Linda Allard would be well able to exploit. The first move into sportswear for Ellen Tracy was a white ottoman peacoat with brass buttons and sailor pants that Allard designed. The blazer was a major departure for the label, as well as being expensive, yet it sold by the thousands and established Ellen Tracy in the junior sportswear sector. In 1991 she launched COMPANY, a lower priced line designed for weekend and casual work dressing. Allard also designed shoes, evening wear, and accessories. After working with Gallen for nearly 40 years, as a loving partnership, Linda and Herbert were married to each other in 2001. Linda Allard graduated from Kent State University in 1962 and has always kept contact with her alma mater. She has created the Linda M. Allard Medallion Scholarship there and hosts fund-raising galas regularly. Kent State conferred a Doctorate of Humane Letters degree upon Herbert Gallen in 2003 for his leadership in the fashion industry, and also to express gratitude for sharing his expertise with students at the Kent State Fashion School. He also was thanked for establishing a scholarship and endowment fund in 1985 to support students. An exhibition of 50 examples of Linda's designs has been presented in Autumn 2004, at Kent State University, running through to January 2005. This shows nearly 40 years of her creativity and fashion success. To advertise their products, Ellen Tracy use many beautiful models, but one has been with them for many years now, Cindy Crawford, who joined them in 1987. She is very much the signature of Ellen Tracy. In the year 2001 she signed a $10 million dollar contract with Ellen Tracy. Linda Allard said at the time \"she is a wonderful face for us\".

She afterwards said that this moment changed her life, because from then on her dream was to design haute couture clothes. \n   She took some training in the United States and in 1965 showed her first ready-to-wear collection in New York which she called \"East Meets West\". It was held at the Hotel Delmonico and was a smash hit. Hanae actively sought to promote the interaction of East-West aesthetic values through clothing, and designed for operas like Madame Butterfly and Elektra, as well as ballets like Cinderella and musicals like Evita. Everyone who knew her admired how hard she worked in the early days to come to grips with Western culture and acquire an international reputation by extending her activities overseas. Her appeal to an international audience began in the early 70's. In 1976 she opened a salon in Paris, leading to her appointment as a member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture. She was the first, and so far the only, Japanese designer to be included in Haute Couture. Her first couture showing was in Paris in 1977. The French Government has awarded her the Legion d'Honneur, as well as the Croix de Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres. Her ready to wear and couture lines, especially her Cocktail dresses and evening dresses, are popular worldwide. She has also created designs for shoes, stockings, gloves, ties, belts, handbags, umbrellas, sunglasses, aprons, carpets and lacquerware. Hanae was the first Japanese designer to be decorated by the French government and is grealy honoured in Japan too. When the Japanese Prime Minister visits Washington, she is invited to join the occasion at the White House. She is one of the few women in Japan who sit down with the Imperial family. Mori designed three consecutive uniforms for the stewardesses (flight attendants) of Japan Air Lines (JAL). The first uniform was worn from 1967 to 1970; the second, which created a sensation by featuring a miniskirt, worn from 1970 to 1977; and the third worn from 1977 to 1978. In 1989, Hanae Mori was awarded the French Legion of Honor by President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of France. In 1996, Hanae Mori was awarded the Order of Culture by the Emperor of Japan. In January 2002, she sold her ready-to-wear and licensed apparel business to an investment group composed of Rothschild of Britain and Mitsui of Japan. They will take over her directly operated shops, and plan to expand the Hanae Mori chain in the United States and Europe. She has 60 retail outlets in Japan and one each in New York and Paris, at present. Not having to worry about the business and financial side of her label, Hanae Mori was thus able to concentrate fully on the creative design couture side of her house. She has also shared a happy fashion partnership with her son's wife Pamela, so that they jointly took bows at the end of a fashion show. Pamela brought her own ideas for zippered jacked and elongated cardigans which co-existed with Hanae's graceful chiffon dresses fluttering with butterfly prints. In June 2004, Hanae Mori announced that after the Haute Couture Show for Fall 2004, to be held in Paris in July 2004, she will be retiring and closing her Couture house. Her ready-to-wear and accessory lines were bought by Mitsui and Co. Ltd., in 2002, and will continue to trade.","the_look":"A delicate sense of feminine beauty, stemming from Hanae Mori's Japanese heritage, is married to an artistic use of color and fabric in all her work. She treads a careful line, balancing Eastern influences with Western ideals to produce consistently successful couture and ready-to-wear lines with international customers. If her clothes lack the more outrageous, attention-grabbing qualities of some of her couture counterparts, they compensate with the economy of their cut and base their appeal on the practical needs of the wealthy metropolitan women who wear them.\nBy stepping outside current trends and concentrating on conservative but always feminine daywear, Mori has established a niche for herself in the Parisian fashion arena. Integral to this is the sense of the longevity of her easy-to-wear separates, which even in the ready-to-wear line retain a delicacy of touch through the textiles used. Mori elaborates on the basic tenets of combining fine fabrics and flattering cut, adding her own feel for the dramatic to her eye-catching eveningwear. For this she makes optimum use of the lustrous printed textiles produced by her husband until his death in 1996. Although there is an air of restrained elegance to much of her design, symbolized by the fragile butterfly motif by which she is known, her eveningwear often breaks into more vibrant realms.\nIn 1981 Mori produced a languorous silk mousseline dress, the vampish leopard print and deep d\u00e9collet\u00e9 of which were balanced by the soft, sinuous fall of the fabric. Other examples used bright hot colors, juxtaposed in one ensemble to provide interest, bringing a strong Japanese feel to their narrow hues, frequently harking back to the kimono for their silhouette and cut. It is in this area that her work is most inspired, bringing together European tailoring and Japanese color and ideals of beauty. She uses the Japanese love of asymmetry to further develop her style and the linear patterns she prints onto her distinctive silks. She exploits the natural appeal of such fabrics with a well-defined sense of cut to illuminate her realistic styles. By doing so, Mori is providing both an alternative to and a definite rejection of the type of elaborate couture confections that mold the female form into fantastical shapes, ignoring the woman beneath the fabric.\nThe other main strand to Mori's design is her close involvement in the arts. Her early costuming of innumerable Japanese films enabled her sense of color to evolve, using each primary-hued textile to represent a different emotion, and sharpened her sense of the dramatic effect of dress. This has grown in her work for opera and ballet, the clothing full of delicacy and poise counterpointed with strong coloration, the arresting mixes representing the two worlds her design principles straddle.","who_wears_it":["Princess Grace of Monaco and Crown Princess Masako of Japan"],"perfumes":["1995  Hanae Mori Parfum (W)","1996  Eau Fraiche","1997  Hanae Mori (M)","1998 Haute Couture (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Hanae Mori"]}

She probably joined Vogue around 1916-1918. On the left is her first Vogue cover. drawn by her in February 1919. \n Harriet Meserole maintained a constant presence throughout the twenties, as much on Vogue's cover as inside the magazine. Emerging from the decorative aftermath of Art Nouveau, by the middle 20's, her graphic identity was clearly established, a delightfully mannered, disciplined simplicity and calm elegant sophistication. She was at times prepared to lace it with harder, sharper, more daring line. \n In 1923, she says about herself \"I like simplicity in all things and people. I hate prettiness and ice cream. I also like being one of your younger artists.\" \n   In 1924 Leon Bakst creates a collection of 10 new crepe prints, and Harriet Meserole, the most instinctively Parisian and stylized of Vogue's artists in New York, shows them off as lovely garments. These new prints make wonderful dresses, in their brilliant hues and original designs. A storm of approval indeed follows. In 1926 a sketch could only encourage the prospective voyager and another sketch from 1928, of a girl in the rain both appear in the book \"Fashion Drawing in Vogue.\" As always her illustration shows a cool and beautiful American lady. This was her last cover for Vogue although she continued to do sketches within the magazine. By 1933 she is a notable absentee from Vogue covers or illustrations and given the impressive substance of her work for Vogue over so many years, such neglect is remarkable.

The family name was Fischer which was changed to Fisher after immigration. \n Harrison Fisher was born in Brooklyn New York, USA, on July 27th, 1875. He had one younger brother. His great grandfather, grandfather and father were all artists. At the age of 6, he was taught to draw by his father, the landscape painter Hugh Antoine Fisher. \n The family moved from New York to California in 1881. Harrison studied at the San Francisco Art Association (later named the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. At the age of 16, after studying at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art in San Francisco, Fisher began selling his illustrations free-lance. \n   In 1894 Fisher's father and two sons opened an art studio in San Francisco. The San Francisco Call newspaper began buying his sketches of accidents, street scenes and social gatherings. These had to be done quickly to meet deadlines. The news baron William Randolph Hearst owned the paper. In 1897, Hearst transferred Fisher to New York to beef up the New York Journal which Hearst had just acquired. Fisher also secured a job with Puck magazine as a cartoonist. By 1900 he had built a reputation for himself as a professional illustrator. During the first quarter of the 20th century, his artwork appeared on over 80 covers of the Saturday Evening Post. He contributed regularly also to the American Weekly. He became well-known for his graceful drawings of mobile and animated young women, notably on the covers of the fashion magazine Cosmopolitan. His \"Fisher Girl\" and \"American Girl\" became the epitome of beauty in America during the 10's and 20's. He illustrated many of the dresses in fashion during the early part of the century. From 1913 till his death in 1934, he created almost every cover for Cosmopolitan magazine. He died in 1934 at the early age of 59. When he died a relative took a few of his paintings, and burnt the rest, sending about 800 Harrison Fisher originals up in smoke.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Henriette Kanengeiser","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/henriette-kanengeiser\/"],"biography":"Hattie Carnegie was a clothing and jewelry designer based in the United States during the 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s. She was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary in 1889 as Henrietta Kanengeiser. \n Their family moved to the USA and changed their name to Carnegie. Hattie was the second oldest of seven children. Her father was an artist and tailor and was thought have introduced her to the world of fashion. At the age of 15, she began work in Macy's New York department store, making hats. \n Five years later, in 1909 she opened a shop on East Tenth Street in New York called Carnegie - Ladies Hatter. The shop was successful, and within a few years she moved to the tony Upper West Side, where she took up dress design. However, she never learned to sew. A friend explained that \"Hattie couldn't sew a fine seam, but she had a feeling about clothes and a personality to convey her ideas to the people who were to work them out.\" She changed the name of her business in 1914 to Hattie Carnegie, Inc., and by the 1920s was the toast of the fashion world from her new location in the Upper East Side. \n   Carnegie's expensive original designer clothes were out of reach for many Americans, but this did not limit her influence on American design. Hers were among some of the most widely copied designs by popularly priced designers. As the decade wore on, Carnegie added a modestly priced, ready-to-wear line in 1928 of clothing that proved to be the most lucrative of her enterprises. She made her modestly priced clothes more available to the average consumer by permitting some department stores to carry the new line, breaking from her usual practice of selling her clothes at her own shop. This practice secured her influence over both haute couture and popular wear. Between the two World Wars, she imported many designs from French couturiers and much of her success lay in her ability to translate French fashion sense into American taste. She was widely influential among other designers, like Norman Norell, Pauline Trigere, Gustave Tassell, James Galanos, Travis Banton, Jean Louis and Claire McCardell, and employed all the following people at various times. She also took on some of the most famous American fashion designers of the twentieth century, such as Norman Norell, Pauline Trigere and James Galanos; for nearly a decade, the made-to-order department was headed by Pauline Fairfax Potter. During the 30's and 40's Carnegie's name was synonymous with smart conventional suits and dresses. Her tailored suits in grey worsted with straight skirts, tidy collars and jeweled buttons and her neat black dresses became status symbols for American women. Inspired by haute couture, Carnegie avoided any extravagance in her designs. Many hats designed by Hattie Carnegie were seen in classic movies of the 40's. She was a very innovative milliner. In 1947, Life Magazine declared Hattie Carnegie to be the \"undisputed leader\" of American fashion, with more than 100 stores selling her product and her label being the keenest sign of prestige in American clothing. She was famous for a shade of blue, which became \"Carnegie blue\" and also favoured black. At her salon in New York, a lady could purchase a complete outfit, including accessories such as hats, gloves, lingerie and even costume jewellery. She became a highly visible designer during World War II when the unavailability of French clothes thrust her own designs into the spotlight, along with American textile companies which she patronized. Hattie Carnegie designed the Women's Army Corps (WAC) uniform in 1950. They were adopted for wear on New Year's Day 1951. June 1 1952 Hattie received the Congressional Medal of Freedom[citation needed] for the WAC uniform design and for her many other charitable and patriotic contributions. The WAC design was so timelessly elegant that it was still in use for women's U.S. Army uniforms in 1968. Hattie Carnegie died in 1956; the fashion empire she had built survived into the 1970s, but in 1965 the custom salon was closed and the company concentrated on wholesale businesses. The informal youth culture of the 1960s and 1970s was ill-suited to the type of clothing and client that had made Hattie Carnegie's reputation. The strength of her personal identification with the company made it difficult for it to succeed without her, and it quickly lost ground to the younger desginers who emerged in the 1960s.","the_look":"Carnegie's belief in simplicity fit perfectly with the streamlining of 1930s design. She believed that \"simple, beautiful clothes \u2026 enhance the charm of the woman who wears them. If you have a dress that is too often admired, be suspicious of it.\" The dress, she insisted, must fit and not overpower the woman who wears it. She was unabashedly devoted to Paris fashion and made regular buying trips throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Yet while she was a self-declared Francophile, she adapted French style to American tastes by offering a blend of style and comfort that suited many fashion-conscious Americans who still wanted their clothes to have a French flair.\nThe Carnegie customer, whatever her age, seems to have been neither girlish nor matronly, but possessed of a certain decorousness. Even the casual clothing in the Spectator Sportswear and Jeunes Filles ready-to-wear departments was elegant rather than playful. The Carnegie Suit, usually an ensemble with dressmaker details in luxury fabrics, traditionally opened her seasonal showings. She often stressed the importance of black as a wardrobe basic, both for day and evening, but was also famous for a shade known as \"Carnegie blue.\" Perhaps Carnegie's preference for 18th-century furnishings in her home relates to the devotion of formality so clearly expressed in her business.","who_wears_it":["Joan Crawford and the Duchess of Windsor"],"perfumes":["1928  Hattie Carnegie (W)","A'Gogo","Carnegie Pink","49","Golden Lotus","Hypnotic","(all in the 1940's)"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}

She studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. \n She went out in the world to build a career around 1907 after graduating. \n She became well-known in the 10's and early 1920's as a designer of magazine covers, and writer of fashion articles especially for Vogue magazine. The book \"Fashion Drawing in Vogue\" says that Conde Nast, the owner of Vogue \"relished the decorative fantasies of Helen Dryden.\" He gave her every opportunity to get her work in front of the public who read Vogue. \n   Helen illustrated 4 covers in 1910 and 3 covers in 1911, as well as contributing many drawings inside the magazine. She then went on to become one of Nast's favourite illustrators, contributing 4 covers in 1912, 5 covers in 1913, 6 covers in 1914, 5 covers in 1915, 6 covers in 1916 and 2 covers in 1917. From then on, Helen did contributions for illustrating articles, but did not do any further covers. In 1923, she contributed an illustration for a costume ball. Vogue said \"for all her wayward decorative instincts, never quite forgets those Eastern tricks, devices and refinements and that the costume ball unmasks the sobriety of conventional citizens.

Helen Dryden had been a long-standing contributor in New York even up to 1931. She has shown a group of fashionable people at the airport wearing clothes designed by the house of Chanel in Paris. However after around 25 years with the magazine, her career with Vogue was almost over and her lively, consummately stylish and pretty aestheticism, an idiosyncratic confection of Beardsley, the Japanese print and Art Nouveau was not seen much in the thirties. Home-grown American as she was, she was among the first to set the visual tone of Vogue's new look. No other of Nast's principal illustrators was like her, and her work bears the closest comparison with that of the Frenchmen like Brissaud and Lepape, who came from the Gazette du Bon Ton. She spent more than half a century after she left Vogue, but we do not know much about her life during that period.

{"designer_name":"Herbert Kasper","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/herbert-kasper\/"],"biography":"Herbert Kasper has made his name as a designer by working predominantly for one company, Joan Leslie in New York, whom he joined in 1963. In 1980 he became vice president of the company as well as designer, creating high fashion looks that reflected trends but were commercial and wearable. \n Herbert Kasper was born in New York, USA, in 1926. He studied English and advertising at New York University but left college prematurely to serve with the US Army in Europe. After military service in World War II, where he designed costumes for the troupe shows in which he took part as a chorus boy, Kasper enrolled at Parsons School of Design in New York. He then spent two years in Paris perfecting his skills, with a short period at l'\u00c9cole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, Paris, and positions at Jacques Fath, Christian Dior and Marcel Rochas. Returning to the U.S., he worked for the milliner Mr. Fred, where his reputation grew. In his next position as dress designer for a company called Penart, Lord & Taylor in New York\u2014which was promoting American designers\u2014said they wanted to feature his work. Kasper's designs were then featured as Kasper of Penart. His talent was for making inexpensive clothes look exquisite and expensive, which endeared him to several other Seventh Avenue manufacturers in the 1950s. \n Side by side, he contributed to Elle magazine. In the early 1960's, he returned to New York and started making clothes with his own label. \n   In 1963, he was awarded the prestigious Coty Award for American designers. Joan Leslie (1902-1966) had a flourishing womens dress and sportswear comany in New York. When she died in 1966, the house called on Herbert Kasper to take over the design. He was subsequently made Vice President of the concern, which was known as Lesley Fay Co. Inc., where he remained till 1985. In 1971 Kasper began a lower-priced line of casual separates called Kasper for J.L. Sport as well as his regular line for Joan Leslie. Part of his fashion philosophy has been that clothes should always work together, so he often found it difficult to differentiate between these two lines when designing. A coat for Joan Leslie Dresses, he once declared, could work equally well with the less expensive separates line for J.L. Sport. Kasper jackets were usually cardigans instead of blazers, his pants tended to be full and flowing. During the 1980's his designs included daytime and nightime dresses, as well as his modified versions of the popular bows, poufs and swags of fabric that were the signature of the decade.","the_look":"Kasper is a designer who really cares about his customer. He wants the person who buys a dress to enjoy it and return for more. His satisfaction comes from seeing a woman look and feel good in his clothes. His reputation has always been that of a respectable craftsman who honors all levels of production involved in creating fashion, from design to manufacture.\nKasper's clothes have always been associated with couture garments, at sportswear prices. He was a master at translating an expensive, tailored cut into a mass-market price tag. He excelled in knitwear, suede and silk garments. Most of his evening clothes have been covered up and restrained. A plain long dress might be enlivened by fabric woven with glistening threads or with a necklace embroidered around the neckline. Almost all of Kasper's short dresses ended just around the knee. \nWhile working in Paris, Kasper noted that women spent a great deal of money on custom-made clothes, ordering several outfits for different occasions. He formed a philosophy based on these observations that individual garments should be mixed and matched with many others to create several outfits, a sportswear concept that has become a way of life in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nKasper has always been a great socialite. His social life inspired his work because it gave him an insight into how people live, their attitudes, and changing tastes. As a designer he is happy with his work, regarding each creation as one of his own children, which in a way justifies his devotion to his craft.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

He originally intended to be a journalist but found he was better at drawing than writing. He taught himself to draw by going to museums and copying the work of Toulouse Lautrec, Utrillo and other painters from the turn of the century. \n Meanwhile, in order to earn a living, he was a door-to-door salesman, gave boxing lessons and ran a restaurant where he doubled as the chef. \n In 1980, Prosper Assouline, the editor of La Mode en Peinture asked him to illustrate the fetes at the Palace a wild Montmartre nightclub and Romain's career took off. Anna Piaggi, eccentially chic journalist, published many of his drawings in Vanity and he became a regular on the fashion scene for La Mode en Peinture, Vogue Sport, Passion, Liberation and l'Express.

{"designer_name":"Hiroko Koshino","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/hiroko-koshino\/"],"biography":"Hiroko Koshino was born in 1938 in Osaka, Japan. Her father was a tailor. She is the eldest of three Koshino sisters who have all become designers, Junko (born 1941) and Michiko (born 1950) Koshino are also now well-known. \n Like many of the Japanese designers who went to Paris In the early 80's, she formed herown company and started showing separates which draw on the basic Kimono shape. \n Her confidently scaled garments have earned her a wide reputation. \n   Koshino's overall business, as of 1997, was estimated to generate $100 million a year. Clothes under her label, distributed through 200 stores in Japan, sold more in that country than products marketed under many other well-known global designer names. Although she has long had global recognition\u2014Koshino was one of the first Japanese designers to show her collections in Rome and in Shanghai, for example\u2014she spent the late 1990s focusing on her native Japanese market. She closed her Paris-based shop and discontinued showing Paris collections after more than a decade as a fixture there while continuing to show in Japan, not only in Tokyo but in other Japanese cities such as Osaka. In 2002, Koshino expects to launch a new perfume line, which, since it is being developed in Paris, may lead the designer to reintroduce her collections in France.","the_look":"Junko exists in contrasts, Curves and straight lines, light and dark, round and square, man and women. She claims opposites come together to form a whole. \nShe says: \"Clothing is your second skin. As you care for your skin, you should take care of your clothes. But don't take yourself too seriously. Relax a little. There are lots of new facets you can find out about yourself.\" \nJunko looks for inspiration to French sculptor Cesar, who fashions scrapped autos into object d'art. \nSleek color-blocked sports uniforms, distinctive forward-looking corporate and exposition uniforms, costumes of opera fantasy and grandiloquence, and future-aimed clothing characterize the work of Junko Koshino. While producing a fashion and lifestyle line for men and women, Koshino's notable strength derives from her strong play between the individual and the group. Ironically\u2014at least to a conventional view of fashion as self-expression\u2014Koshino's best works are her uniforms, collective vestments, not the elective garments of individuals. Her sports samurai are elegant and reductive, almost a kind of refashioned nudity streamlined by fashion as a shell. In outfitting sports teams, she has excelled, noting the aerodynamics of sports and applying those principles to her technology-aware garments.\nKoshino's sports uniforms realize Marinetti's visionary comparison toward \"new beauty\" in his 1909 Futurist Manifesto of the racing car and the Victory of Samothrace. But she has also sought the individual identity of futurism, a clothing inspired by the 20th-century dynamic of projecting oneself into an even more technologically intense outlook. Cocoons and spirals, concentric circles, ribbed construction, and materials from plastic to metal to cloth are typical of Koshino's exploring mind.\nIndividual pieces are likewise utopian in vision. \"Taikyoku\" is the guiding philosophy of the work, signifying contrast and balance or harmony. Mystically and philosophically, the circle is most important to Koshino, who sees the form as complete and eternal, both ancient and futuristic. This symbolic approach to form animates not only Koshino's view of apparel but the outreach of her work to lifestyle and environmental design. As a designer, she has convened an Art-Futur Committee of various artists, designers, and thinkers, but she has also gone back into history to provide costumes for Mozart's Magic Flute and has shown her work in the Museum of History in Beijing. Moreover, Koshino has played a major role, in the late 1980s and 1990s, in introducing fashion ideas to China.\nKoshino challenges almost every preconception about fashion from the materials available for clothing to the way in which clothing serves the commonwealth and the individual. Philosophically (and she requires such thought), she is cognizant of the past but straining with futurist and utopian vision. She brings fashion into fuller and more fulfilled discourse with the other arts of design. It is the area of attainment that gives Koshino a distinctive and enduring place in the history of design.\nKoshino continues to design functional garments featuring geometric, sometimes asymmetrical shapes, bright and contrasting hues, varied lengths, and fabrics that range from alpaca to materials incorporating gold powder. She emphasizes the natural and places a focus on the feminine, yet she is not adverse to trying something new, such as creating clothes from metals, as she did in her winter 2000 collection.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hirokokoshino_official","brands":["Hiroko Koshino Premiere","Hiroko Bis","Hiroko Koshino"]}
{"designer_name":"Holly Harp","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/holly-harp\/"],"biography":"Many students are torn between the glamor of stage or film design and high fashion. Holly Harp was able to merge both her love of costume and fashion into a successful professional career that lasted more than 25 years. Harp went with an early instinct after designing sandals on a whim, and returned to college with her sights set on becoming a designer. She studied in the theatre department and worked on her fashion degree. Her style was dramatic, feminine, and refined. \n Holly Harp was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1939. She studied art and costume design at North Texas State University. She married twice, first to Jim Harp. She has a son Tommy. \n When a designer's devotees include Barbra Streisand and Courtney Love, you know she has range. Such was the case with Holly Harp, a fashion-loving flower child who set up a boutique on Sunset Boulevard in 1968. It became the pinnacle of Los Angeles fashion. \n   Holly captivated Hollywood with a rich hippie look in the 60's right up to the early 90's. She was twice nominated for the Coty awards. She died of cancer in 1995 at the age of 55. This year a retrospective exhibition of her work was held, comprising of dresses from her house model Ann Hoover, and Pam Paul, her very first customer. Dresses have also come from Julie Belafonte, one of her biggest fans. Her first husband Jim Harp has collaborated in setting up the exhibition. Holly Harp created costumes for films such as \"Cabaret\", \"Sleeper\" and \"The Turning Point\". Even though she has gone, her beautiful dresses live on and give pleasure to so many women who wear them, and people who see them.","the_look":"Harp moved to the West Coast during the height of hippiedom in 1966. San Francisco hippies tended to borrow street styles and recycle clothing salvaged from the local Goodwill, while Los Angeles, where Harp set up shop, was more interested in marketing styles and trends in the form of new designs. The latter was more of a \"rich hippie\" look. Harp was inspired by the youthful street fashions and was referred to by the Los Angeles Times as the city's \"doyenne of feathers and fringe.\" Harp's clothes suited the tastes of the youthful population who loved psychedelic colors and melodramatic effects.\nIt was more than being in the right place at the right time. Harp began to distill her designs into her own personal expression. During the 1970s there was more emphasis on the body. The soft matte jersey Harp experimented with became a signature fabric along with chiffon. There was a continuation of using beadwork, flowers, feathers, and airbrushed designs but with a softer, refined touch. Harp used complicated draping techniques to emphasize feminine qualities rather than the prevailing minimal approach.\nHarp became known for making fabulous dresses that attracted the attention of the Hollywood \u00e9lite. \nThe ability to create clothing with both romantic and classic qualities carried Harp through the 1980s into the 1990s; by limiting her production and not overextending herself, Harp maintained the integrity of her designs.","who_wears_it":["Goldy Hawn","Diana Ross","Angelica Huston","Liza Minelli","Jane Seymour","Lauren Hutton","Bette Midler","Jane Pauley","Sally Field","Ryan O'Neal","Jon Voight","and Jack Nicholson","Mary-Kate Olsen"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Holly Harp"]}

Hans arrived in Brazil as a Jewish German immigrant when he was just 17 years old. \n Stern started his career in the gemstone industry when he began working the Rio de Janeiro-based company, Cristab, which exports precious stones and minerals from Brazil. Stern traveled to Minas Gerais state as part of his job, where he came to know the local miners. He also became familiarized with many of the precious stones that were mined in the area, including topazes, tourmalines and amethysts. He became fascinated by the vibrant gems of Brazil and decided to promote them internationally, targeting foreign travellers. In doing so, he gave birth to a new industry. \n   Stern founded his company, H. Stern, in 1945, in order to market Brazilian gems. There was no real market for Brazilian gemstones at the time. His company would eventually grow into a multinational jewellery empire. Stern and his company trained a large number of young Brazilian jewelers as H. Stern gained customers and market credibility. His work propelled the Brazilian jeweler industry up to international standards.. Stern was also the first to create a worldwide warranty certificate, and to offer tours of his workshops to present the creative and production process with integrity and transparency. One of his main goals in life was achieved when important international gemological institutes revised the old \"semi-precious\" definition of colored stones and began referring to them since as \"precious colored stones\". Stern coined the phrase, \"There is no semi-precious stone as there is no semi-pregnant woman or semi-honest man\". Stern's company, H. Stern, grew into a retail chain of more than 160 stores throughout the world. The first international boutiques appeared in Frankfurt, Lisbon and New York in the 1970s. For many decades the company focused its creations on Hans' beloved colored gems, although Stern also won several Diamonds International Awards and other prizes for avant garde diamond designs. Stern's favorite gemstone was the tourmaline, a stone which is commonly found throughout Minas Gerais. Hans Stern died on October 26, 2007, in Rio de Janeiro at age 85. Stern had been hospitalized for days before his death.He was survived by his wife, Ruth, whom he married in 1958.

He donated the Hope Diamond to the Smithsonian Institution in 1958 after owning it for a decade, and traded the Portuguese Diamond to the Smithsonian in 1963. \n Born in 1896, Harry Winston became one of the most well-known American jewelers. Known as a jeweler to the rich and famous, he was also an important donor of famous gems to museums. The company he founded continues to create sought after pieces. \n Winston's career as a gem trader reputedly began in 1908 when as a twelve year old boy Harry noticed a plain ring with a green stone in a pawnshop window. The pawnbroker believed the stone to be about a quarter of a carat and so sold it for 25 cents. Harry took the ring to his father, Jacob, a small local jeweler, who was amazed to see an emerald weighing two carats. Two days later, Harry sold the stone for 800 dollars, and thus began a legendary jewelry empire. \n   Winston's jewelry empire began with his acquisition of Arabella Huntington's famous jewelry collection. The wife of railroad magnate Henry Huntington, Arabella amassed one of the world's most prestigious collections of jewelry, largely from Parisian jewelers such as Cartier. When Winston purchased the collection after her death, the designs of the collection were quite old fashioned. Winston redesigned the jewelry into more contemporary styles and showcased his unique skill at jewelry crafting. According to the Huntington museum, \"He frequently boasted that Arabella's famous necklace of pearls now adorned the necks of at least two dozen women around the world.\" Harry Winston dared to make history in 1949 by acquiring the most famous diamond in the world. The Hope Diamond, a masterpiece much improved, was among Harry Winston\u2019s greatest treasures. In 1958, we donated it to the Smithsonian Institution. It is Harry Winston\u2019s gift to the world. Winston was among the most famous jewelers in the world, well-known to the general public.

This collection 1985 revealed an approach to design which was more sculptural than tailored, with bold shapes in denim, linen and jersey. In 1998, after twelve years of intense production, Isobel stopped presenting her bi-annual collections. Today she creates at her own pace, keeping her garments hidden until they meet her standards of excellence. She says: \"I see clothes three-dimensionally and I am often more interested in the space between the body and the cloth.\" Isobel doesn't sketch, she works in prototypes, and nobody, not even she, knows how the clothes in the collection will turn out. In the year 2000, the Kent State University held an exhibition called \"Toledo\/Toledo, a Marriage of Art and Fashion\" displaying the work of Isabel and her husband Ruben. Toledo was named creative director of Anne Klein in 2006 after more than twenty years of working solely under her own name; she was let go from that position in 2007. Along with her husband, RUBEN TOLEDO, ISABEL was the receipient of the COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN AWARD for their work in fashion in 2005. Toledo made her debut with Anne Klein at New York Fashion Week in February 2007 to critical acclaim. She and Anne Klein parted ways, however, a few months later.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Anne Klein","Ak Anne Klein","Anne Klein New York","Isabel Toledo"]}

{"designer_name":"Issey Miyake","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/issey-miyake\/"],"biography":"Issey Miyake is the most well-known Japanese designer in the world, having successfully merged East and West in his designs. Issey Miyake was born in Hiroshima, Japan on 22 April 1938. He studied at the Tama Art University in Tokyo during which time he assembled his first fashion collection, which he named \"The Poem of Material and Stone\" In 1964 he graduated from the University of Tokyo. In 1965 he moved to Paris to study design at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. In 1966 he left to work as an assistant designer at Guy Laroche. He also worked in the studio of another great couturier Hubert de Givenchy. However, he felt out of step with the posed formality of the haute couture approach to dressing which was all that Paris could offer to women at that time. However, revolution was in the air, and such designers as Courreges and Cardin were designing modern clothes. \n In 1969 Issey Miyake left for New York. He worked as a designer for Geoffrey Beene, producing ready-to-wear clothes and enjoying the atmosphere of the city. He was also refining his ideas about dress and the function of fashion. Was the result, was his theory of peeling away to the limit, throwing away all the inhibiting ideas about dress and starting again from the beginning. \n In 1970 Miyake returned to Tokyo to make his ideas concrete. \n   In 1971 he founded the Issey Miyake Design Studio in Tokyo.He also opened a boutique at Bloomingdales in New York. During the 70's while still based in Tokyo, Miyake began to show his collections twice a year in Paris and they rapidly became fashion shows which no fashion addict could afford to miss. In 1976 he presented 12 black girls from America, striking black Amazons showing his designs in Osaka which were seen by 15,000.people. In 1977 he mounted \"Fly with Issey Miyake\" in Tokyo which was seen by 22,000 people. In the late 80s, he began to experiment with new methods of pleating that would allow both flexibility of movement for the wearer as well as ease of care and production. This eventually resulted in a new technique called garment pleating and in 1993's in which the garments are cut and sewn first, then sandwiched between layers of paper and fed into a heat press, where they are pleated. The fabric's 'memory' holds the pleats and when the garments are liberated from their paper cocoon, they are ready-to wear. He did the costume for Ballett Frankfurt with pleats in a piece named 'the Loss of Small Detail \" William Forsythe and also work on ballet \" Garden in the setting \". In 1995 several designers, joined in a project to illustrate characters from films. Issey Miyake has drawn POCOHONTAS the red Indian heroine of the Disney cartoon film. In 1994 and 1999, Miyake turned over the design of the men's and women's collections respectively, to his associate, Naoki Takizawa, so that he could return to research full-time. In 2007, Naoki Takizawa opened his own brand, supported by the Issey Miyake Group and was replaced, as a Creative Director of the House of Issey Miyake, by Dai Fujiwara. In Fall 1998, the Cartier Foundation in Paris dedicated a large exhibition to him in a space designed by the architect Jean Nouvel. Miyake himself chose the title: Making Things. On this occasion, Philippe Tr\u00e9tiack wrote for Elle magazine: \"He has never cease to search, interrogate, scrutinize his materials and he has drawn various replies and signs in order to design what might be the clothing of the future. A tailor of the wind, a poet of delicacy, an architect of a feather-light armor for the next millennium, Miyake, year after year, is becoming the master, the guru of the most fluid modernity.\" For the Spring-Summer 2000 collection, significantly called A-Poc (A Piece of Cloth), a single piece of cloth became a long or short skirt, a T-\"shirt, bikini, socks, and gloves. In 2000, after 30 years at the forefront of design, Issey Miyake announced that he would be handing over the reins of ready-to-wear to his right-hand man Naoki Takizawa (born 1960) who has been with him since 1989. He studied in Japan at the Kuwasawa Design School. For Spring 2000 Takizawa gave the Miyake main line new direction, with cropped jackets and fitted shift dresses in simple pared-down silhouettes and fluid shapes. Issey Miyake is not hanging up his scissors yet though. He says \"I want to go back to basics\". He will focus on the A-POC range pushing the concept that real clothes can be made from a single piece of cloth. His A-POC shop opened in Spring 2000 in London. Now, recently, he has opened a huge futuristic new store in Tokyo, Japan, in the same building wherein he had founded his company in 1971. Miyake sells approximately 200,000 garments every year and more than 100 factories in Japan work for him.","the_look":"Miyake's skill with fabric is rooted in his knowledge of traditional Japanese fabrics and fabric-production techniques. The ascendancy of denim in the sixties and seventies turned his attention to Japanese workwear fabrics: ticking stripe, heavy cottons, quilting. These he incorporated into his work both in their original form and in wonderfully elaborated forms, waffle textures, heavy coarse weaves, rich seersucker effects, wrinkled, crinkled, primitive pleating and occasionally smocked. \nCombined with Miyake's sophisticated colour sense, the effect of all this sensuous texture was completely fresh. Textured fabrics when employed by other designers, tended to be conventionally rich - velvet, plain, panne or printed, brocade, damask, corduroy or applique work, embroidery or lace, nubbled or hairy tweed. Even when used in fresh unexpected ways other designers cannot compete with the fabrics Miyake has developed, which respond well to being intricately cut, seamed, darted and fitted. This is consistent with his vision. He says \" I like to work in the spirit of the Kimono, between the body and the fabric there exists only an approximate contact.\" \nHe does not use the kimono itself as many Western designers do, to add a touch of exoticism. He merely borrows its attributes of ease, adaptability and respect for the fabric and the patterns and shapes in space with it can create when the body moves. \nIf he sounds serious about his design philosophy, we he is. But he also has a rich sense of humour which contributes substantially to his famous charm. He loves to make extravagant statements when he sends his models down the runway in shiny fibreglass breastplates, or perky nipples or polished wickerwork torso cages shaped like Samurai armour. \nHis use of wrapping and tying techniques for the fastening of his clothes is also based on Japanese tradition. The kimono has no closure and it closed by tying the obi around the waist. \nHe makes clothes like 18th century Buddhist priests, where patchwork rectangles were meant to suggest the humility of tatters, although they were actually stitched from the finest of antique brocades. Miyake refines and passes on the inherently Japanese vision. His loose, even formless clothes mock the perfect-toned \"me decade\" body, he makes fashion retrospective.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1992  L'Eau de Issey (W)","1994  L'Eau de Issey pour homme","1995  Sun Mist (W)","1998  Le Feu d'Issey (W)","2000  Le Feu d'Issey Light (W)","2000  L'Eau d'Issey d'Ete Relaxante (W)","2001  Soleil d'Issey (W)","2001  Lune d'Issey (W)","2002  Air and Light(W)","2002  Lumiere d'Issey (M)","2002  Soothing Night (W)","2002  L'Eau d'Issey d'Ete (W)","2003  L'Eau d'Issey Souffle (W)","2003  L'Eau d'Issey Souffle (M)","2004  L'Eau Bleue d'Issey (M)","A new Issey Miyake men's fragrance, L'eau d'Issey Pour Homme Intense, was introduced at Nordstrom in the United States in June 2007, with a larger worldwide rollout following in September 2007.

Boyhood days were spent soaking up the 19th century paintings in his father's art gallery and admiring his mother's high-heeled shoes. \n Istvan's sketching talent led him to the Belgrade Academy of Applied Arts. From there, he went to work in the Budapest theatre as a costume designer. In the mid-1980's, he left for the United States. He studied at Parsons School of Design in New York, graduating in 1987. \n He won the CFDA Perry Ellis Award for student designer of the year, and Donna Karan who presented the Award, signed him up on the spot.

His debut collection for Fall 2002 presented in January 2002, was adventurous, whimsical and crafty. It was inspired by snowflake patterns and 19th century paintings by Giovanni Boldini.

{"designer_name":"Isaac Mizrahi","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/isaac-mizrahi\/"],"biography":"Mizrahi was born in Brooklyn, New York of Egyptian Jewish heritage. He is the cousin of rock guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, former player in the New York Dolls. \n When Isaac was eight, his family moved to the middle-class Midwood section of Brooklyn. He contracted spinal meningitis during this time and his confinement was spent eating junk food and viewing television, especially old movies. The 1961 remake of Back Street, about an affair between a fashion designer and a married man, was a pivotal event in Mizrahi's development. The glamour of the fashion industry depicted in the movie became an inspiration to him to design clothes. When Isaac was 10 years old, Zeke Mizrahi bought a sewing machine for him. Isaac set up a workroom in the basement and created clothes for puppets for neighborhood birthday parties. At 13, Isaac was designing clothes for himself, his mother, and a close friend of his mother, Sarah Haddad. \n His earliest design influences stemmed from his his mother's all-American wardrobe, which included clothing from Halston, Geoffrey Beene, Claire McCardell and Norman Norell. \n   1982 Graduated from Parsons School of Design, New York. Worked for Perry Ellis, and said he was a major influence who taught him how to cut a dress, and many lessons in life. After this, he worked with Jeff Banks and Calvin Klein. After leaving Calvin Klein, in June 1987 he and Sarah Haddad-Cheney pooled $50,000 each and opened Mizrahi's own womenswear company. They occupied a loft on Greene Street in SoHo. Seven stores bought the first season's collection. By the first collection show in April 1988 Haddad-Cheney had secured additional financing from the owners of Gitano Jeans company. In 1990 the company's workrooms and showroom moved to an expanded space on Wooster Street. Mizrahi's menswear collection premiered in April 1990. 1990 Isaac Mizrahi is presented with the CFDA designer of the year award for his women's wear collection. The year 1997 proved to be a milestone in Mizrahi's career. He announced an unprecedented deal with three major Asian markets in Japan, Singapore, and Korea which included freestanding stores, in-store shops, wholesale distribution, manufacturing, and sublicenses in Japan and shops and distribution in Southeast Asia, an online ABC source reported. The deal was estimated to generate at least $150 million in retail sales by the year 2000. Mizrahi has made appearances in numerous television shows and movies since the 1990s. In 1995, a movie was released about the development of his Fall 1994 collection called Unzipped made by his freind Douglas Keeve. In fall 2005 the Isaac show debuted on Style Network. He previously had a show on the Oxygen network. His new less-expensive line ISAAC, opens in 34 locations around the USA. Each boutique will show his new logo, a Silver Star. He often appears on many of E!'s programs and has become well-known for being flamboyant and considered by some to be rude. He also appeared as himself in the episode \"Plus One is the Loneliest Number\" of the fifth season of Sex and the City. He also guest starred on the American dramedy series Ugly Betty, in which he played a reporter for the cable channel Fashion TV in the episode \"Lose the Boss\". Mizrahi also appeared as himself in The Apprentice season 1 (episode 6) as one of the celebrities auction for The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. He made a series of comic books called Sandee, the Adventures of a Supermodel, published by Simon & Schuster. Mizrahi is currently the spokesperson for Klein-Becker's StriVectin anti-wrinkle cream. He is developing \"The Collection,\" a one-hour scripted project that draws on the experiences of the designer for The CW Network. Known for his magnetic personality and witty style, Mizrahi has won four Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) awards. He is famous for his use of colour and the clean flattering lines of his designs. Chanel, who was financing him, pulled the plug and Isaac had closed his own fashion house in 1998. He started his own TV show interviewing celebrities. However in February 2003, Mizrahi entered into a new partnership with New York based Hip retailer TARGET. Isaac created an exclusive collection of classically designed fashion sportswear and accessories for style conscious women. The collections are named \"Isaac Mizrahi for Target\" and he unveiled his debut collection in April 2003 in Minneapolis at the Walker Arts Center. Target is putting the designer back on the fashion map in a major mass-market way. Mizrahi's television show will be featured in the advertising and marketing campaign for this new line. When he was interviewed in September, Isaac said he was very happy working with Target. Certain aspects of the couture scene and the constant rush to try and make money, just made him unhappy. Now he is making clothes for ordinary Americans at reasonable prices, and they are \"racy, fun and crazy\" and very popular. But Isaac's heart has always been with fashion shows, and in June 2004 he put on his first show in six years, and it was really successful. The show celebrates Bergdorf Goodman's decision to devote space in its American couture collections for Mizrahi's label. The designs can also be seen on www.target.com","the_look":"It is as if Mizrahi was challenged by distilling the most well-bred form of each garment to an understated glamor, whether tartan taken to a sensuous evening gown but still buckled as if Balmoral livery; pocketbooks and luggage ingeniously incorporated into clothing with the practical pocket panache of McCardell; or versions of high style in adaptations of men's bathrobes or sweatshirting used for evening. While Mizrahi was often commended for the youthfulness of his clothing, the praise was for the freshness of his perception, his ability to recalculate a classic, not just a market for young women. His interest in the Empire waistline; his practicality of wardrobe separates in combination; and his leaps between day and evening addressed all women equally.\nMizrahi had clearly demonstrated the range of a commercially viable designer while at the same time demonstrating his simplifying glamor and the cool nonchalant charm of his smart (intellectually and aesthetically) clothing. \nMizrahi had referred to his style as a \"classic New York look,\" which presumably meant a casual American idiom, but inflected with big-city reserve and refinement. Mizrahi captured something of Manhattan chic and glamor of the 1940s and 1950s. His fashion was indescribably beautiful in subtlety and sophistication. Yet Mizrahi soon gave it all up to pursue another dream\u2014performing.","who_wears_it":["Cindy Crawford","Madonna","Sandra Bernhardt","Natasha Richardson","Liza Minelli","Oprah Winfrey","Uma Thurman"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Isaac Mizrahi","Liz Claiborne New York"]}

His clothes had an international appeal as well as understanding the traditions of British life. He noted \"a couturier worth his name must design in the world-stream of design change, but direct it to the lives of his clients that make this business exist.\" In 1964, he said \"Couture will and must continue, it is the lifeblood of the ready-to-wear\".

He moved to France with his family in the mid-50's. \n His simple enveloping clothes remain true to the uncut cloth. Thick, felt-like fabrics have preoccupied him since him as at boarding school, when he cut his first garment out of a blanket. \n   In 1968, Castelbajac began designing for his mother, who had her own clothing business. Soon after he created several lines for Paris manufacturer Pierre D'Alby. He opened his own business in 1975 and immediately achieved fame. He was one of France's new ages of ready-to-wear designers and worked with Pop Art themes such as Andy Warhol's Soup can painting, which he printed onto a cylindrical dress in 1984. He was also inspired by the work of designers Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin, on the theme of Futurism and has designed Space Age collections. Also in 1984, he designed a dress made of heavy denim material with the front shaped and painted like the crotch opening of a pair of blue jeans. While continuing to design under his own name, he simultaneously created Sportmax for the Italian house of Max Mara. He mixed his personal life and his interest in movies, music, art and the environment with his clothing design. Castelbajac, has created many clothes featuring printed logos, messages or images. He is famous for his chic yet rugged daywear and also for his hand-painted fabrics which did much to influence the \"wearable art\" garments popular during the 80's. While continuing his own label, he also started designing for the Paris house of Andres Courreges in the mid-90's. In 1997, Castelbajac designed garments for the Pope and senior ecclesiastical members of the Vatican. Protection and security was the guiding concept of Castelbajac's winter 99\/2000 collection, which was entitled \"State of Emergency\" and was held in a Paris metro station. It featured protective clothing like padded coats that looked like military sleeping bags, and hats like those worn by the UN Security forces. His Fall 2002 menswear collection was held on an ice rink outside the City Hall in Paris. He had his models on skates in huge oversized clothing, which should please all those heading for the Alpine ski slopes.

{"designer_name":"Jeanpaul Gaultier","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/jeanpaul-gaultier\/"],"biography":"  Jean-Paul Gaultier is a French fashion designer and past television presenter. Furthermore he is one of the most talked about and influential couturiers in the world. His designs are always unusual and controversial and he is the darling of the fashion press. \n In 1952 Jean-Paul Gaultier was born in Arcueil, France. Gaultier never received formal training as a designer. He studied at the Lycee d'Arcueil. \n   When only 14, in 1964 he started sketching his fashion ideas on paper. For 2-3 years, he continued this. Instead, he started sending sketches to famous couture stylists at an early age in 1969. Pierre Cardin was impressed by his talent and hired him as an assistant in 1970 on Gaultier\u2019s birthday, 24th April. In 1971 Gaultier joined Jean Patou, the famous couture house, as Asst. to Michael Gomez, then Angelo Tarlazzi. In 1973 he joined Jacques Esterel. Then in 1974 he returned to Pierre Cardin looking after his store in the Philippines, where he designed clothes for Imelda Marcos. In 1976 Gaultier started to manufacture the first electronic jewellery with his collaborator, Mr. Francis Menuge. In 1976 in October, he presented his first collection under his own name, at the \"Palais de la Decouverte\" comprising articles such as furnishings, table sets in plaited straw. In 1977 he started his own firm, for couture. In 1978 his first collection with partner Kashiyama. He held twice-yearly collections of feminine wear, the most important of which. He has long been known as the \u201cenfant terrible\u201d (bad boy) of French fashion. Many of Gaultier\u2019s following collections have been based on street wear, focusing on popular culture, whereas others, particularly his Haute Couture collections, are very formal yet at the same time unusual and playful. In 1981 Gaultier changed his partner and Kashiyama went back to Japan, where he still produces Gaultier products under licence for Japan and the Far East. Sales in Italy were handled by Gibo for woven goods and Equator for knits. In 1984 Gaultier achieved recognition world wide with his men's collection \"men in skirts\" In Brigitte Bardot's famous film \"God Created Woman\" men wore trousers like pencil skirts. This inspired his collection. In 1987, he won the French Fashion Oscar Award. In 1988 Gaultier launched his jewellery line. In 1993 Gaultier launched his perfume \"Haute Perfumerie\". In 1996 Gaultier designed all the costumes for the film \"Fifth Element\" He currently designs for three collections: his own couture and ready-to-wear lines, as well as the newly relaunched clothing line for Hermes, a French leather goods company well-known for their equestrian background, scarves, and expensive and difficult to obtain handbags. Hermes has financed Jean-Paul Gaultier since 1999, to the extent of 35 % of his company. In May 2003, they announced that Gaultier would become the chief designer at the house of Hermes, replacing Martin Margiela. Gaultier will design for them beginning with Fall\/Winter 2004. This is the first time that Jean-Paul has designed for any house, other than his own label. Jean-Paul Gaultier staged a retrospective exhibition in London at the Victoria and Albert Costume Museum, in May 2003. It showed all the creative garments of his career, and was a great success.","the_look":"Gaultier does not like primary colours, he prefers ivory and half tones. His images are tiny but sacrilegious, his cut a little better, his vision breathtaking. He is a designer who has made his reputation by attaching 12\" conical breasts to Madonna and putting men in Lycra jumpsuits covered in small diamond shape mirrors. As his fantasies wing their way down the runway, you see Backless T-shirts, cutaway jackets with more space between than fabric, a riot of prints, insanely skirted mens pants and beautiful women. Very little is what one would expect. This sets him apart from other controversial designers. He starts with some classic point, something people are familiar with like a blazer, or a chemise, then he deforms it, knots it, stamps on it, but retains its classic shape. Gaultier's vision of 21st century clothing is spray-on disposable clothes, seamless and without openings. To take it off, one would pull firmly and throw away. According to Gaultier, our clothing has not changed drastically up till the 20th century, and styles and construction have not kept pace with advances in technology. He says changes are imminent. He will probably be the designer putting them into practice. He popularised the use of skirts, especially kilts on men\u2019s wardrobe, and the release of designer collections. Gaultier caused shock by using unconventional models for his exhibitions, like old and fat women, pierced and heavy tattooed models, and by playing with traditional gender roles in the shows. This actions granted him both criticism and enormous popularity.","who_wears_it":["Madonna","Nicole Kidman"],"perfumes":["1993 Jean-Paul Gaultier Parfum (based on Schiaparelli bottle of \"Shocking\" from 1937)","1993 Haute Perfumerie","1993 Summer Fragrance","1994 Jean Paul Gaultier Eau de Toilette","1996 Le Male","1999 Fragile","2000 Classique","2002 The Buddhist","2002 L'Eau d'Ete (W)","2003 Classic (W)","2005 Gaultier 2 (W)","2005 Gaultier Summer (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Herms","Jeanpaul Gaultier","Jp Gaultier","Gaultier Paris","Jean Paul Gaultier Haute Couture","Gaultier Junior"]}
{"designer_name":"Jeanne Lanvin","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/jeanne-lanvin\/"],"biography":"  Madame Jeanne Lanvin's active fashion career spanned 50 years from the 1890's up to the New Look just after World War II. \n In 1867 Jeanne Lanvin was born in Brittany, France. She was the eldest of 10 children of a pair of Breton concierges. She first trained as a dressmaker at a house called Talbot and then as a milliner. \n   In 1890 she opened a millinery shop in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore. While making hats, she also made dresses for a younger sister and her daughter. Lanvin's clothes came to the attention of other mothers with daughters, who asked her to make dresses for them, so in 1909 Jeanne began making dresses for sale and her reputation grew. She made no distinction between women's and children's wear, the youthfulness of both being an important aspect of 20th century fashion. Demand by young women for her clothes, persuaded Jeanne Lanvin to open a couture house selling mother-daughter garments. Paul Iribe, the famous illustrator, created the Logo for the house of Lanvin, from a drawing by Jeanne of the bond between mother and daughter. Her daughter became the Comtesse de Polignac, and continued to wear her mother's beautiful gowns. In 1913 Lanvin created her famous \"robes de style\" based on 18th century designs. These small waisted, full skirted dresses remained popular for many years and were fore-runners of the New Look which Dior brought out just after World War II. In 1914 influenced by orientalism, she turned to exotic evening wear in Eastern-style velvets and satins. During the 20's Lanvin made a simple Chemise dress which later became the basic outline for the twenties. Over the following years, she introduced several interesting developments. In 1921 a Riviera collection introduced Aztec embroidery. In 1922 a Breton suit appeared in the Lanvin collection. This comprised a gently gathered skirt, a short braided jacket with lots of small buttons and a big white organdie collar turning down over a red satin bow. A sailor hat topped the outfit. In 1926 a menswear division was opened by Lanvin, and so she became the first couturier to dress whole families. Her branches were opened in Nice, Cannes and Biarritz. Jeanne Lanvin dressed film actresses like Mary Pickford, Marlene Dietrich and Yvonne Printemps in the 20's and 30's. She also had clients like the Queens of Italy and Roumania, and English princesses. The house of Lanvin, like all other houses, suffered throughout the 2nd World War, although she kept designing. In 1946, Jeanne Lanvin died at the age of 79. Her daughter Marie-Blanche took over the running of the house, till she herself died in 1958.","the_look":"Her work was easily recognizable by her skilful use of embroidery, and her fine craftsmanship. She used a particular shade of blue so often, that it came to be called \"Lanvin Blue\". For Jeanne Lanvin, women were meant to wear clothes of unabashed feminity, in colours that were pretty, and whose shapes had a \"young girl\" look. She set the mood with narrow empire-wasted dresses and long trailing sleeves. The fabrics that she used were silk, taffeta, velvet, silk chiffon, organza, lace, tulle, etc. She used a lot of free-flowing ribbons, ruffles, flowers, lace, mirrors, etc., and liked ornamentation like applique, couching, quilting, parallel stitching, and embroidery.","who_wears_it":["Natalie Portman"],"perfumes":["1925 My Sin","1927 Arpege (originally created by Madame Lanvin as a birthday present for her daughter)","1928 Arpege Eau Delicieuse","1928 L'Ame Perdue(W)","1928 Petales Froisses(W)","1931 Scandale (W)","1932 Rumeur (W)","1933 Monsieur Lanvin","1933 Eau de Lanvin (M)","1937 Pretexte (W)","1964 Vetyver","1965 Crescendo (W)","1969 Chiaro","1971 Via Lanvin (W)","1979 Lanvin l' homme","1981 Lanvin for Mem","1983 Clair de Jour (W)","1997 Lanvin (W)","2000 Oxygene (W)","2001 Oxygene (homme)","2002 Eclat d'Arpege (W)","2003 Vetiver (M)","2005 Rumeur (W)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Lanvin","Jeanne Lanvin"]}

{"designer_name":"John Galliano","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/john-galliano\/"],"biography":"In 1961 Juan Carlos Antonio Galliano was born of Spanish parents Anita and Juan Carlos Galliano. In 1966 his parents emigrated to London with Juan and two daughters. He attended Wilsons Grammar School and excelled in languages. While doing his A levels, he took up textiles and put together a portfolio to present to St. Martins College of art. He was accepted. He experimented with bias cutting, reviving and refining it. He worked with Tommy Nutter, in Savile Row, London's famous tailors street. He noticed that sleeves swung forwards, as if cut on the curve, so that you could really move your arms. He began cutting sleeves in a spiral so that his armholes could be neat and even cut trousers on the bias to make legs look slender. \n During 1983 at the Victoria and Albert Museum costume archives, they allowed John to spend time sketching and examining dresses by Vionnet and other classic designers and he kept this research secret. \n In 1984 his graduation collection at St. Martins was 8 garments called \"Les Incroyables\" a fantastic, impeccably produced series of garments based on French Revolutionary garments of the 1790's. Joan Burstein of Browns, snapped up all the dresses and put them in her window. They sold out at once, one was bought by singer Diana Ross. \n   John was offered a job in New York, but just as he was leaving, Joan Burstein called him for a repeat order. He and his friends made the garments at top speed and he was on his way to success. In 1985 while designing clothes for the album cover of Malcolm McLaren's Madame Butterfly, he met Amanda Grieve (later Lady Harlech) who was a fashion stylist noted for originality. They worked together on a series of exotic collections with names like \"Afghanistan repudiates Western Ideals\" and \"Fallen Angels\" or \"Blanche du Bois\" or \"Lucid Game\". She has remained his great friend and a muse who takes an active part in his creative process, accessorising his extraordinary clothes with frail twiggy birdsnest hats and shoes like 18th century. Galliano officially launched his own label in 1984, producing historically influenced designs laced with a contemporary edge. Part romantic, part maverick, Galliano was always a couturier at heart and delicate bias-cut gowns and superbly tailored suits fast became his trademark. In 1987, they won him his first British Designer of The Year award. But his financial difficulties did not end, so in 1990, Galliano turned his back on London and joined the ranks of international designers seeking their fortunes at the ready-to-wear collections in Paris. There a friend lent him studio space and Andre Leon Talley, creative director of American Vogue, took him under his wing and introduced him to everyone important in Paris. In 1989, he started presenting collections of slinky bias cut Dresses. In 1992 John Galliano presented his \"Princess Lucretia\" collection with extravagant crinolines. His 1994 collection was financed by John Bult, Swiss Chairman of Paine Webber International, an investment bank. It was held in the Paris mansion of Portuguese socialite Sao Schlumberger. She has been dressed by Dior and Chanel, but says \"Galliano is a great designer\". The show made fashion headlines and had buyers rushing to order. Galliano says \"we had time to show only 17 outfits but each was perfect.\" In 1995, John Galliano presented his \"Back to the 40's\" Collection. He also dressed Diana, Princess of Wales in a dark blue lace-edged evening gown. Happily, in 1995, Galliano was appointed chief designer at Givenchy, becoming the first British designer to head a French couture house. He grabbed headlines with a series of risqu\u00e9 designs aimed to transform the profile and fortunes of the back-dated company. A year later, on 14 October 1996, Galliano was awarded the glittering prize of the house of Christian Dior - Givenchy's stablemate at LVMH. His first couture show for Dior coincided with the label's 50th anniversary, 20 January 1997. These days, between his label and Dior, Galliano is responsible for producing six couture and ready-to-wear collections a year and a new mid-season range under his own name. He also follows a rigorous exercise regime, which sees him rise at 6am each morning to complete a gruelling, 40-minute aerobic session with his personal trainer, before embarking on a 10-minute stretch, 150 push-ups and a six-mile jog along the banks of the Seine. In 2000, he went as far as to claim that he also had found his inspiration for the couture collection of boho-meets-hobo chic he unveiled that January during his jogging sessions, as he ran past les clochards, the homeless people, lining the river, adding that he hoped to expose the pure decadence of the couture by \"turning it inside out\". 2001 Late in the year, John Galliano was awarded a C.B.E. by Queen Elizabeth of England, for his services to fashion. When word got out, there was great speculation as to what outrageous clothes he would wear for the ceremony. However, he was quite sober, only wearing the customary morning coat made by Brioni but without a shirt underneath. It was the eve of his 41st birthday. He was made a Chevalier in the French Legion of Honour in January 2009. In June 2010 the designer was given France's highest award, the Legion of Honour, by Nicholas Sarkozy. The 2010 season saw him celebrate 15 years working at Dior - he marked the occasion with a collection inspired by one of Dior's long-term friends and original illustrators, Rene Gruau. In February 2011, Galliano was arrested for an alleged assault and shortly afterwards a video appeared online of him apparently making anti-Semitic remarks towards people in a Paris bar. As a result, Dior dismissed him from his role as creative director on March 1 2011.","the_look":"He has managed to balance fantasy and classicism, which is very difficult to achieve. Galliano raids history for ideas. From the Highlands of Scotland to the Russian steppes, from thirties style sleek evening gowns, to kilts, tulle ball gowns, farthingales, frock coats, hourglass silhouettes, even 1940's gangster garb. His interpretation is unique, with a highly defined sense of the theatrical, and his technical skills are thoroughly modern. He has trained himself in the craft of fashion, not only the art. His garments have a tremendous sense of romance and whimsical charm, coupled with precision tailoring. His exquisite slip dresses, floating ball gowns or exotically tailored suits, float above fashion, remarkable in their unashamed loveliness. He also depends on a team of superbly artistic designers for his accessories, Stephen Jones for hats, Manolo Blahnik for shoes, Odile Gilber for hair styles and Stephenie Marais for make up. They all seem to adore him and his clothes. John also gives chances to young designers to work with him.

MacDonald was taught knitting by his mother, and soon became interested in design. \n He graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1996 but even before that, in 1995, he had started his solo career designing knitwear under his own name, as well as for Karl Lagerfeld, Alexander McQueen and Koji Tatsuno. \n Seductive and opulent, Julien MacDonald's work takes the girlishness out of knitwear. He spins out fiery fantasies from his trusty knitting machine. \n   Julien met the German designer Karl Lagerfeld when he won the annual Lagerfeld competition while at college. As a result, Lagerfeld hired him as knitwear designer for Chanel in 1996, and told Vogue: \"Julien plays with his machine like Horowitz plays on his piano.\" MacDonald uses new modern fluorescent yarns and luminous mohair. In 1997, the designer founded his own company and created his own label. He debuted at London Fashion Week, and his show was an instant commercial success. His Autumn\/Winter collection was entitled \"Mermaids\" and his Spring\/Summer 1998 was called \"Modernist\". During the latter, he presented suit-of-armour dresses rather like those of Paco Rabanne. It was a surprise when Bernard Arnault (chief officer of LVMH who own Givenchy, Dior and others) appointed Julien Macdonald the British designer, as chief designer for Givenchy haute couture. His first collection was Spring 2001 which was well received. His most recent collection for Givenchy is Autumn\/Winter 2003 held in Paris in March. MacDonald presented the Haute Couture Spring\/Summer 2004 show for Givenchy in January and it was a beautiful show. However soon afterwards, he announced that he would be leaving Givenchy when his contract is up in April. He has not indicated his future plans. Julien unveiled his couture-clad BARBIE at the glittering show in the March, dedicated to the fashionable doll. The event was attended by loads of celebrity daughters including Lisa Mafia's daughter Chelsea and Bob Geldorf's daughters Peaches and Pixie. The clothes were rock and roll, glitter and serious glamour. In September 2004, Julien was awarded an honarary degree by the University of Wales, Newport, U.K. He was also selected by British Airways to redesign their flight attendants' uniforms. He also acts as a judge on the British version of Project Runway, known as Project Catwalk, which is broadcast on Sky One. In June 2006 he was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to fashion. MacDonald has attracted much criticism for his extensive use of fur, including one incident in which he and Paris Hilton were flour-bombed. He has stated that fur provides the majority of his revenue and that his label would collapse were he not to use it. In February 2007, Macdonald was again criticised for the prominent use of fur in his autumn collection, causing further outrage when he claimed that \"People who don't like fur can p*ss off.

He went on to attend Bunka Fashion College in Tokyo, graduating in 1984. \n At this time he began his apprenticeship at Comme des Garcons, the company run by legendary Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo, as a patternmaker. In 1987, he was promoted to chief designer of Tricot knitwear line and then moved on to design for the Comme Des Garcons Homme line. \n Starting in 1992, he has worked under his own name as part of Comme des Garcons. He started his own line under the Comme Des Garcons name called \u2018Junya Watanabe Comme Des Garcons\u2019 in 1993 and began showing in Paris that same year. \n   In 1994, Junya Watanable launched his own label. A few days after his own collection, he presented the collection for his friend Rei Kawakubo.","the_look":"His designs do reflect the principles of his mentor Kawakubo, but he takes a personal approach to his garments. He changes dramatically each season, taking a stab at futuristic designs, like wrapping neon punks or abstract oriental peasant wear, to poetic stark white. He gives his clothes an irregular touch through random tucking and pleating or ruching. \nGlamour, sound and colour are notably absent from his design shows, and he keeps a vast distance between his models walking on the catwalk, so that the viewers can give full attention to each design as it appears. \nIn 1995, his collection was all boiled wool and black leather with tattoos on the models. \nIn 1997 he put his own stamp on florals, models seemingly cocooned in Japanese style prettiness but their sculptural half-dresses were conventional from the front and cut away at the back to reveal baggy embroidered trousers. Every outfit was crowned with a folded turban-style wig. \nIn 1999, he has given cape sleeves and an uneven hemline to a white Indian cotton multi-layered dress and the model said that suddenly when worn, all the fabric makes sense and it feels much different on a body than when it is seen on a hanger.  \nHe is particularly interested in synthetic and technologically advanced textiles and fabrics as found in his spring\/summer 2001 line but also uses more traditional materials such as cotton in his spring\/summer 2003 collection. Watanabe is often considered to be a \u2018techno couture\u2019 designer, creating unusually structured clothes out of modern, technical materials.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/junyawatanabeofficial","brands":["Junya Watanabe"]}

She is quite well-known for collaborating with Peter Saville for Showstudio.com for an on-line project called \"Forget-Me-Not.\" \n In Winter 2001\/2 she had an exhibition and book \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" at London's Mobile Home Gallery. She presented about 20 drawings dedicated to her top 20 favourite songs. \n   Her drawings of erotically charged Lolitas and pixie princesses have appeared in The Face, Self-Service, the Fashion, the Sunday Times, Nova, the Independent, and Dazed and Confused magazines. One of her present occupations is teaching fashion design and illustration for the MA course at Central St. Martins Fashion College in London. She worked with John Galliano (her first boss after college) . In the late 80's she drew John Galliano's girls. Then she worked for Jasper Conran on costumes for \"My Fair Lady\". She lived for a while in Conran's house in Regents Park, London. From 1993 till 2000 Julie had a long-standing relationship with Martine Sitbon in Paris, working as a design assistant and then as a consultant. She has worked as a design consultant with Jasper Conran, Richard Tyler, Guy Laroche, Jean Colonna and Clements Ribeiro and was also creatively involved with styling at the Italian house of Byblos. In the music industry, she kept busy illustrating cover sleeves of albums by Gloss and Great 3, and illustrating pop promos for Sugar Babes and Mel G. The Italian house of Gibo run by Franco Penne, found Julie Verhoeven to be a very talented designer. They wanted to launch their own range so that the Gibo brand would become well-known. Their choice of Verhoeven to design their collections shows Gibo's understanding for fun and wearability. Her first fashion show for GIBO was for Spring\/Summer 2003. Garments showed two-tone graphics and clashing colour-blocked outfits, frilly blouses, rah-rah skirts and conical-heel pumps. At the request of Marc Jacobs, Julie in 2001, created a set of smash hit cute nutty clouds\/butterflies\/animals applique bags for Louis Vuitton. Vuitton made a limited edition of 100 in each of four styles and the waiting lists grew and grew, despite the 1,000 pounds price tag. It was the \"have to have\" bag of the year.

Her second collection for GIBO was presented during London fashion week in February 2003, for Autumn\/Winter 2003. Her collection included wide-collar two-tone coats, shirred and draped slinky dresses, lots of novelty buttons, quilted satin, lace and giant junk jewelry. One dress with multiple colour prints on it, was very popular but had a secret. Julie said \"there are actually breasts and other graphic details in the prints, it is really quite naughty.\" It is shown on the right.

After graduation and separate apprenticeships Badgley with Donna Karan and Mischka with Willi Smith, the pair formed their own company in 1985. \n Their showroom was in the Hells Kitchen district of Manhattan. It was up an old staircase and got crosswinds which often blew the gowns across the car park. In 1992 however, they managed to get financing from the German company of ESCADA. In 2001, Escada launched a cost-cutting initiative which did help the company to show a profit on sales of $ 40 million. \n   They decided to specialize in evening wear and now stars and celebrities are clamouring for their unique brand of elegance, particularly for Oscar night. Their 1987 show attracted buyers from major departmental stores who were drawn to their elegant, contemporary versions of classic designs. In 1989, they won the Mouton Cadet Young Designer Award, and in 1992, the Dallas International Apparel Rising Star Award. In recent years they have attracted a Hollywood clientele for the Decollete Cocktail dresses and tunics encrusted with beads as well as off the shoulder bridal gowns made of ivory lace and silk crepe. Since 1992, their house has been financed by Escada, USA. As part of the campaign to Aid Breast Cancer Research, more than 70 designers took part and made in-store appearances. Most of these have stores in New York's 5th Avenue. Badgley Mischka created a beaded bag which went on sale in Autumn 1999, with a percentage of the proceeds going to this charity.

Browns, the famous store bought many of the garments in his collection. His knitted three-piece outfit, a strapless tube worn with a long pleated skirt and a long sleeveless coat with a draped back, was a great success. \n   Azagury began his own retail operation in London's Knightsbridge, London in 1987. As well as specializing in exclusive cocktail and special occasion wear for private clients, he also sells pieces to other fashion stores and top couture retailers throughout the UK. The operation is as chic as any Parisian couture salon and was complemented by Azagury's sister, Elizabeth, and her exclusive floristry business, Azagury Fleurs, which is run from the basement of the shop. His brother's shoe design label, Joseph Azagury, is run from premises nearby. He specializes in glamorous evening clothes for an international market. His clothes were great favourites with Diana, Princess of Wales. His first dress for her was a 20's style ballgown worn in the mid 80's. In 2002, the very experienced Azagury was selected to head a team taking over the designing of the couture collection of the house of Hardy Amies, at Savile Row, London. The old house was to be completely revamped for the 2 1st century. However after only a few months, the team was disbanded and Ian Gallant (the personal choice of Hardy Amies) took over the design.","the_look":"He went on to design some of her most daring and sexy dresses, during the last few years of her life. One was a black dress on an embroidered sequin bodice, worn when she received an humanitarian award from Henry Kissinger in New York in 1995. \nHis glamorous style was perhaps best epitomized by the princess in the summer of 1994 when she walked out of the Ritz Hotel in London, to be met by the glare of the awaiting paparazzi, in a stunning Azagury black, graphite, and bugle bead sheath with sensuous side split.\nAzagury does not design for one particular type of woman, preferring to appeal to a huge cross-section from the ages of 13 to 60. He is adamant that what a woman does not want when purchasing eveningwear is fancy dress. Some eveningwear designers layer sequins, frills, ruching, and draping to create an overstated, unflattering fantasy, but Azagury uses sequins and frills with taste and discretion. The clothes never make major fashion statements but veer instead toward the classic and flattering. Their innovation and style come from Azagury's respect for cut and fit, and he devotes a great deal of time to getting this right.","who_wears_it":["Princess Diana","Duchess of Kent","Joan Collins","Madonna","Emma Thompson","Elizabeth Taylor","Demi Moore","and Britain' First Lady","Cherie Blair"],"perfumes":["2007 Cosmic (W)","2006 Stoned (W)"],"social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jacques_azagury","brands":[]}

Jacques Doucet was in love with elegance and worked to achieve it in his couture designs and in his private life. His clothes were of perfect taste and luxury, his name the only one equalled with Worth. \n He built a reputation as a connoisseur by his superb collection of 18th century works of art and paintings. He became a patron of Impressionists and African sculpture. In 1909 he purchased Picasso's first cubism painting Demoiselles d'Avignon and put in in a special wing at the head of a crystal staircase. \n   Jacques' grandmother was a bonnet seller and lace merchant in the 19th century. Her son Edouard, expanded the business into linens for gentlemen. In 1871, Jacques Doucet opened a salon selling ladies evening gowns, made of lace, silk ribbons, flowers, feathers, braid, beadwork and embroidery. He used rare gros point de Venise lace for entire dresses. His ensembles were as romantic and opulent as the ladies in his 18th century paintings. Paul Poiret worked for Doucet from 1897 to 1900. Doucet died in 1929, and his house was merged with Doueillet, but the merger was not successful and it closed in 1932.

A designer of taste and discrimination, Doucet valued dignity and luxury above novelty and practicality and therefore gradually went out of popularity during the 1920s. By far his most original designs were those he created for actresses of the time.\nFor Doucet, dignity and luxury were more important than novelty. His designs lacked the simplicity of Vionnet or the shock value of Poiret, and slowly he began to be described as \"stuffy\". He dressed a generation of women but did not attract their daughters. \nA passionate collector of art and literature throughout his life, by the time of his death he had a magnificent collection of Post-Impressionist and Cubist paintings (including \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", which he bought direct from Picasso's studio), as well as two libraries of manuscripts by contemporary writers, both of which he left to the French nation.\nWhile little-remembered today, in his time he was equalled to the likes of Charles Worth and Jeanne Paquin and even now is remembered by fashion historians as one of the great old masters of fashion design.","who_wears_it":["Doucet's clothes were worn by Rejane","a famous actress of the day whose taste was legendary.  \nCecile Sorel","Rejane and Sarah Bernhardt (for whom he designed her famous white costume in L'Aiglon) all often wore his outfits","both on and off the stage."],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Jasper Conran","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/jasper-conran\/"],"biography":"Jasper Conran was born in 1959, in London, the son of Sir Terence Conran, who has influenced British and European home furnishing design since the 60's. He founded Habitat where homes were built on authenticity and and design integrity. His mother is Shirley Conran who is a successful writer and journalist. She was Woman's Editor of the Daily Mail. She organizes \"Mothers in Management\" a group formed to help working mothers. \n Conran studied at the Parsons School of Design in New York from 1975 to 1977, and his first collection was produced for Henri Bendel in the United States. He returned to the UK and worked briefly for the British company, Wallis, as design consultant, producing its Special Label. He introduced his first independent womenswear collection in 1978 showing black cashmere trousers, and coats and jackets lined with cream satin. \n In 1977, he joined the British firm of Wallis as a consultant. \n   Conran considered Jean Muir as his mentor in fashion style. In 1978, when he was only 19 years old, Jasper Conran showed his first collection under his own name. For more than two decades, he has retained a simplicity of approach which produces an easy, soft fit that suits many of his society clientele. He uses quality fabrics, cut into comfortable garments, which do not impose themselves on the wearer. In addition to designing under his own label, he creates a capsule wardrobe for Debenhams, simply called \"J\". He has a playful sense of humour, an incisive mind and a reputation built on an instinctive knowledge of what a woman wants to wear. Conran has chosen not to give fashion shows, but concentrates on his collections. In 1985 Jasper launched his Menswear line, which now represents 60 % of his clothing sales. He is a perfectionist and has spent years perfecting the shape of a jacket, months getting the cut of a pair of trousers just right. In 1992 Jasper Conran joined with Philip Treacy, master hat maker, to design the costumes for a touring production of \"My Fair Lady\". In 1990 Conran signed a ten-year licensing agreement with the Marchpole Group Plc, the UK subsidiary of Bidermanns S.A., to produce and market his men's clothing lines. Michael Reiney, managing director of Marchpole, described Conran (Bidermann's first British designer) as a \"very talented guy who has not had the opportunity to expand himself to his fullest extent. We believe he has great potential.\" This arrangement would allow for Conran's menswear designs to penetrate the market in Continental Europe and the U.S., and to expand his men's collection to include coats and accessories. Conran would also be able to produce a more affordable line of menswear as well. Founded with a loan from his father of about $ 2,000 and since repaid, the Jasper Conran empire now (2004) has a turnover of about 260 million pounds annually. 14 million pounds comes from his signature line, the rest from licenses including from the Debenhams group which offers Conran designer outfits at lower prices. Jasper has set up a new place in London for everyone to go and buy Jasper Conran's range of womenswear and numerous other products, the house is a Georgian dwelling renovated in modern style. It was originally designed by 18th century architect Henry Flitcroft, and has 5500 square feet area over four floors overlooking Piccadilly. Conran said that his father took a big hand in the decoration and settings. He didn't sound too enthusiastic though. But he does say that he is very happy being his father's son, although the father's celebrity status is a bit overwhelming at times.","the_look":"Dubbed the \"Calvin Klein of London,\" Jasper Conran creates menswear and womenswear collections that epitomize urbane, classic lines. As the British Fashion Council's Fashion Designer of the Year in 1986, Conran has balanced British imagination with international chic. His designs are inspired by early garments of Coco Chanel and the American look of Claire McCardell's monastic and \"popover\" dresses but the outcome reflecting modern sophistication, not retro style. He is known for updated, yet elegant, versions of traditional British tweed suits.\nColor has been an important factor in the overall look of Conran's collections: i.e., the brightly colored cashmere jackets in cerise, orange, chrome yellow, and mint green, produced for the 1992 collection, and earlier eveningwear in fuchsia, cobalt, and kelly green organza highlighting the clean lines of each garment. Silk separates have since been designed in ice blue, cocoa, bright red, and sorbet tints. As his designs moved into the new millennium, Conran, who continues to be considered one of the most successful designers in the UK, toned down his color pallette. His early 2001 womenswear collection featured baby blues, dusky pinks, white, beige, and black. Skinny tie-belts, diamond prints, and tube tops were reinvented, trousers were low-waisted, and A-line leather skirts and satin frocks were suggested for evening wear.

{"designer_name":"Jean Cocteau","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/jean-cocteau\/"],"biography":"Jean Cocteau was born in Maisons-Lafitte, France in 1889. \n He threw himself into every new movement in the artistic world of France, drawing upon artists and musicians like Picasso, Satie and Milhaud to collaborate with him in production of ballets and dramatic performances. He designed for Diaghilev's ballets also. \n He was closely associated with the world of fashion through both the theatre and his friendship with Elsa Schiaparelli who encouraged his non-comformist attitudes and applied his surreal themes to her fashion clothing and accessories. He designed embroidery motifs interspersed with poetic symbols, which she used on evening dresses. \n   Cocteau illustrated many covers for Harper's Bazaar in the 30's. Other Cocteau's designs for Schiaparelli include: 1937 evening cape with sunburst, embroidered by Lesage, 1937 linen jacket with crossed hands trompe l'oeil motif Jean Cocteau was also the inspiration for other designers, particularly Yves St. Laurent, who presented a satin evening jacket in his 1980-81 collection, which was embroidered on the back with a line from a Cocteau poem. In 1980 Yves St. Laurent designed the costumes and sets for \"Cher Monteur\" a play by Jerome Kitty adapted by Jean Cocteau, presented at the Theatre de l'Athenee. Some of Cocteau's most important work was in collaboration with Gabrielle Chanel, the great fashion designer. Between 1922 and 1937 she designed costumes for a whole cycle of his plays, including \"Le Train Bleu\" in 1924 which had a considerable impact on sportswear. He often sketched her and her fashions in his characteristic form of outline drawing. Cocteau wrote and directed several films, and published 20 volumes of poetry. In 1957, he painted the interior of the St. Pierre Chapel at Villefrance. He died in 1963, when he was 74 years old. From September 2003 to January 2004, the Pompidou Centre in Paris put on a vast retrospective of the work of Jean Cocteau. On show were 335 drawings, 300 photographs, 22 paintings and a special projection room for showing his classic films. It was a great success and was visited by thousands.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Jean Dimitre Verginie","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/jean-dimitre-verginie\/"],"biography":"Desses was born Jean Dimitre Verginie, in 1904, in Alexandria, Egypt, of Greek parents. In 1925, he abandoned his legal studies study law, but, in 1925, he abandoned his legal studies and began working for Maison Jane, a Parisian couture house where, in 1937, he opened his own couture salon. \n After World War II, he traveled extensively in Egypt and Greece, and his designs in the 40's and 50's reflected the influences of his travels. He specialized in creating draped evening gowns in chiffon and mousseline, based on early Greek and Egyptian robes. He made embroidered dresses and sheath dresses with tight jackets and flowing skirts. He was a very popular designer with European royalty and movie stars. Among his clientele were the royal family ladies of Greece, the Duchess of Windsor and society hostess Elsa Maxwell. \n His collections were hailed by the press as being very original. Time and again the showstoppers were his intricate flowing chiffon evening dresses. For these he used ombre fabrics, a favourite effect. His fur coats were shaded light to dark. He tried to dethrone the colour black, by use of soft hazy colours in dresses that involved much plaiting and twisting, as one or more fabrics were joined with ribbons or bands of mink. Often scarves trailed from neck to floor, and rippled, like his uneven hems. \n   In 1945, Desses participated in the fashion doll exhibition held in Paris called \"Theatre de la Mode\" held by the Chambre of Couture in the Louvre Museum. Approximately 172 dolls dressed by 40 couturiers were shown. This exhibition subsequently went on tour all over Europe and the USA. In 1949 Desses began producing ready-to-wear lines for the US market. Valentino worked with Desses for several years in the 1950s and gained much hands-on experience, as did Guy Laroche who in the 1950's was Desses' assistant. In 1958, Desses move to 12 Rond Point des Champs Elysees in Paris. In 1963, when he reached 60 years of age, he was in poor health so he closed his business and retired to Greece, where he ran a boutique which he had opened there earlier, in 1955. He died in 1970 at the age of 66. In the 90's, with the surge of interest in vintage dresses, the gowns of Desses have been in great demand.","the_look":"Jean Dess\u00e9s belongs to the small group of couturiers, such as Vionnet, Balenciaga, and Gr\u00e9s, whose clothing combines technical skill with sculptural aesthetic. \nThe hallmarks of his postwar fame are evident in his prewar work. Draped and twisted sashes and bodices, cape or kimono sleeves, a fondness for asymmetry, and ornament derived from the architecture of the garment rather than applied as surface decoration, were all elements of both his day and evening wear in the late 1930s. \nDess\u00e9s' transition from jersey to chiffon may have been mandated by the fuller silhouettes of the 1940s, or perhaps by the fact that Madame Gr\u00e9s was the acknowledged master of the draped jersey column, but the change set him on a path which made his name. By 1958 they were termed \"classic.\" The variations on the theme seemed endless, but there are several important common factors. Appearances notwithstanding, the dresses were not always simple Grecian draperies. The understructures were formal and the cuts were complex, with swags, sashes, bows, and scarves twisted and pleated into shapes that seem effortless and defy analysis; in lesser hands they might simply seem contrived. The dresses also show his sensitive, if somewhat conservative, color sense. Cream or ivory, always flattering, are constants, but Dess\u00e9s often used two or three shades of one hue, or used three different hues, but of equal value, to maintain harmony. It is also worth noting that the garments are impeccably made; every yard of hem in the double-or triple-tiered chiffon skirts has a hand-rolled finish.\nDess\u00e9s was equally deft with crisp silks, rough tweeds, and fine dress wools, and his most skilful and inventive draping and cutting techniques were often allied with these fabrics. Dropped shoulder lines, raglan or kimono sleeve variations, and draped collars softened voluminous mohair coats and tweed suit jackets. Tucks, godets, and intricate seaming molded crepe and gabardine dresses to the contours of the figure. Skirt fullness was swept to the back, folded in at the side, or turned into tiers of flounces which spiraled from hem to hip\u2014all through manipulation of the grain in one piece of cloth.\nThe most successful of his silhouettes, such as the Streamlined and Winged collections of 1949 and 1951, may not have set trends, but they interpreted the trend with elegance. He favored asymmetry and oblique lines, which gave the garments a sense of movement even in repose. Bold, architectural details such as stand-away pockets and cuffs were used like punctuation marks, adding drama and intensity to a silhouette. Dess\u00e9s made complex but not fussy clothes, and, on occasion, did set the trend in 1950 when he introduced a onesleeved stole.","who_wears_it":["Naomi Campbell","Princess Sophia of Greece","Ren\u00e9e Zellweger","Jennifer Lopez"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Jeff Banks","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/jeff-banks\/"],"biography":"Jeff Banks is a renowned Welsh designer of both men's and women's clothing, jewellery, and home furnishings. \n Jeff Banks was born in 1943 in Ebbw Vale, Wales, U.K. His sheet metal worker father left his mother when Banks was aged eight, and she resultantly decided to move to London, England. \n Offered a scholarship to independent grammar school St Dunstan's College in Catford, South London, his mother couldn't afford the uniform so he got a round delivering paraffin on a wheelbarrow - by aged 13 he had employed a man to drive a lorry based tanker, and sold the business aged 15. \n   Encouraged by a teacher to study art and become a painter, he realised his art skills were limited during his first year at London's Camberwell School of Art, and so transferred to studying interior design and latterly textiles at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design from 1959 to 1962. He then went to the United States, where he studied at the Parsons School of Design, in New York. Banks holds honorary degrees from the University of Lancaster, East London, Newcastle & Northumbria, University College for the Creative Arts, and the University of Westminster, and is a Doctor of Arts. In 1964, with money saved from the paraffin business and his father mortgaging his own home, Banks opened the boutique Clobber in London, where he sold garments of his own designs as well as those designed by others. It proved to be such a success that in 1969, he launched his own fashion label. In 1975 he opened the first standalone Jeff Banks shop in London, as well as retail outlets in twenty-two department stores, including Harrods and Harvey Nichols. In 1974, he became involved with the establishment of the Warehouse Utility chain of shops which provides inexpensive fashions in bold colours, for a predominantly young market. He has also worked freelance for a number of companies, including Liberty of London. Throughout the 1970's and 80's, Banks was completely in tune with contemporary fashion. With an imaginative use of inexpensive fabrics, he was able to provide young women with access to fashion without compromising taste. After the Warehouse was taken over by retail chain Sears, he was sacked for being disruptive in board meetings - a decision he never regrets. In 1979 and 1981 Jeff became British Designer of the Year, and in 1980 he was made British Coat Designer of the Year. Banks' standing as a commercial force in retail fashion led to his presenting over 320 episodes of The Clothes Show, the BBC's long-running fashion show, alongside Selina Scott and Caryn Franklin. The show's success of often gaining over 10million viewers, led in 1989 to the first \"Clothes Show Live\" event at the NEC Birmingham, as well as the launch of the Clothes Show magazine. In 2000 the food chain Sainsbury's hired Jeff Banks in a bid to stay ahead of the supermarket trend for selling non-food items. Jeff and Co. clothes went on sale in 76 stores and had just begun breaking through the one million pound a week mark. But in 2003 Sainsbury's terminated Banks contract in October. Jeff feels that Saisbury's wants to reap the profits without paying him anything, and he plans to take legal action against them unless he gets \"well in excess of ten million pounds\" that he feels he is due. However finally he agreed to take a compensation package of 1 million pounds and a box of chocolates every week. He has continued to work as a designer with designs for the Guide Association, the England football team, and recently for London's 2012 Olympics bid, which were modelled at the launch by Sir Bobby Charlton, Sir Steve Redgrave and Denise Lewis. Banks has been married twice. First to the 1960's pop star Sandie Shaw, and subsequently, to Sue Mann, a model and makeup artist. He has converted to Buddhism.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jeffbanks_uk","brands":[]}

He attended Cordwainers's Technical College in London and the London College of Fashion. He is perhaps the most famous of alumni of Cordwainers' Technical College in London, from which he graduated in 1983. The college is now part of the London College of Fashion. Choo has divulged that he worked part-time at restaurants and as a cleaner at a shoe factory to help fund his college education. \n Choo's humble beginnings can be traced back to his workshop in Hackney, East London, which he opened in 1986 by renting an old hospital building. His craftsmanship and designs soon became noticed and he came to the verge of international fame when his creations were featured in a record eight pages in a 1988 issue of Vogue magazine. \n   In addition to delicate high-heels, Jimmy Choo also makes boots which allow designers room for play. Jimmy Choo himself is no longer connected with the shoe designing house which he founded in 1996. In April 2001, he had sold 50 % interest in his company to Tamara Yeardye Mellon, former UK Vogue accessories editor. Jimmy Choo was then a partner but was not involved in running the business. He has since concentrated his work on the exclusive Jimmy Choo Couture line produced under license from Jimmy Choo Ltd. This is available, by appointment only, at Connaught Street off Oxford Street in London. The Jimmy Choo London line, also known as Jimmy Choo ready-to-wear or simply, Jimmy Choo, is now under the purview of Tamara Mellon and Sandra Choi.

Tamara Mellon has led the company to grow in size and reputation. In 2001 she bought out Jimmy Choo completely, for about $ 30 million. The company has expanded from 1 shop in London to 4 stand alone stores in London, New York, Beverley Hills and Los Angeles as well as about 80 retail outlets.

At the same time she edited art books for Harry N. Abrams and wrote columns about art auctions for Art in America. Vass began a cottage industry in the early 1970s when she brought her personal interest in hand-knits and crochet to women who needed an outlet for their marketable skills. \n   In 1974, she began a non-profit making company helping knitters market their skills. She created designs for hats and sweaters, which she supplied to these women. Vass created designs for hats and mufflers which these women crocheted. Marketed at Henri Bendel, New York, they quickly sold out. She went on to create designs for sweaters for both men and women, having them produced under the label Joan Vass New York. Vass provided the designs, the yarns and buttons if necessary. The production for this line was limited, selective, and not accessible to everyone. The Joan Vass New York line was still popular in the late 1990s and into the 21st century. Craftspeople still create the designs provided by Vass and it remains a small-volume, selective design business which now includes woven materials. All of the designs from the past are still available to be produced. Joan realized that she had the talent and ability to design products that appeal to a broad spectrum of today's modern women. In 1976 she started designing woven garments, adding coats and daywear to her collections. She is now known mostly for her sweaters knitted from chenille, alpaca, angora and other fine quality wools. She established her own company in 1977. In the 1980s, a mid-priced licensed line was first produced on a large scale by the Signal Knitting Mills in South Carolina. Working with Vass designs, these clothes carried the label Joan Vass USA and were made of beautiful fine-gauged, natural fiber, knitted and woven fabrics. In 1978, Joan Vass was honoured by the Smithsonian Institute as An Extraordinary Woman of Fashion. In 1979 she received the Prix de Cachet as well as the Coty Fashion Award. In 1980 she introduced 3 new lines, including a menswear line.

Her designs could also be found in high-end specialty shops and better department stores as well, including newer Vass labels for plus sizes and sportswear.

His family moved to London when he was a child. \n He worked as an apprentice to a Savile Row tailor before enrolling at the Tailor and Cutter Academy in 1974. In 1975, he joined Central St. Martin's School of Art, for a one-year History of Art course. \n Joe then joined the music industry and became well-known as a designer of clothing for rock groups. Demand for his clothes off-stage resulted in freelance contracts as well as commissions for costumes for both theatre and film. In 1992, he dressed U2 for their world tour. \n   He launched his own label in 1984 for menswear, followed by womenswear a year or two later. Recently he has expanded into footwear. In 1993, Joe started designing for Top Shop. Casely-Hayford, like Stephen Burrows and Ozwald Boateng, was one of the few early black designers to attain prominence in the international fashion world, and he passes his knowledge along to the next generation; one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s is Wal\u00e9 Adeyemi. Having arrived on the wave of the exciting new art school-trained British designers that included John Richmond and John Galliano, he has also remained dedicated to increasing Britain's fashion standing on the international market. To that end, he is active in teaching future designers, lending his time and expertise to programs like the Marymount London Fashion Program, which teaches students and gives them the opportunity to intern with working designers and get hands-on experience. He has remained very active, showing collections regularly from 1998 to 2001, not only in London but from Paris to Milan and from Rome to New York.","the_look":"Street style elegance combined with sharp tailoring and masterly technique has ensured that Joe Casely-Hayford has an following who appreciate his functional and cutting edge clothes and his club culture influence. \nThe traditional design tenets of quality fabric, attention to detail, and excellent cut underpin all of Joe Casely-Hayford's work. This is not to deny the surprise of his designs, which often have unusual details of decoration or spicy color combinations to enliven them. His clothes are for the discerning customer who wants styles to retain their appeal for more than one season. The clothes are always very contemporary in feel, though rarely following fashion fads. Although he returns to his skillful pleating and cutting of traditional wool fabrics for classic suits each season, his influences are wide ranging. He can just as stylishly redefine 1970s wide collar coats as create American Indian-style soft leather jackets.\nHis menswear is perhaps his perennial tour de force. Always interesting and innovative, his collections are a combination of highly desirable good quality with witty detailing. His clean-cut wool suits are given a stylish twist through pleating or cut-out lapels with curling velvet inserts, making them more individual. His designs may reveal a certain amount of anarchic license in their cut, but he is never cultish or unwearable, carefully balancing the elements in his work with his original vision to make clothes with a long life span. Even his more experimental garments, like the all-in-one suit he created in the late 1980s that looked like a two-piece from the front but had a battle-dress back, still have a beauty in their fit and the refined finish that distinguishes all his work.\nHis clothes for women have a sexy feel, with sculpted leather waistcoats and neatly fitted suits alongside funky knitwear and simple yet sophisticated dresses, each with the usual Casely-Hayford twist marking out their design. His designs are complemented by the seasonal addition of interesting and unusual footwear created for Shelly's, the London shoe chain.\nCasely-Hayford has quietly built a niche for himself in British fashion as a master of cut, and his work has also just as quietly gained an international following, especially in Japan, where his work is very popular. His clothes have the appeal of longevity while at the same time maintaining style and well-balanced beauty through the combination of each element of design, providing carefully thought-out garments that flatter the wearer with their witty detail and consistently good fit.\nHis collections in 2000-01 featured an eclectic riot of colors and fabrics, from orange and green to white and black, from solid to tie-dye, from leather to tweed, from tulle to suede, from fake fur to wool. Described alternatingly as conservative, cutting edge, bold, and subliminal, Casely-Hayford's designs, while remaining experimental, are still very wearable.","who_wears_it":["U2","Liam Gallagher","Lou Reed","Tori Amos","Neneh Cherry","Suede","Glamma Kid","Lynden David Hall","Mica Paris","Black Uhuru","The Clash"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Joe Eula","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/joe-eula\/"],"biography":"Joe Eula was born in Norwalk, Ct., USA, around 1928-1930. \n He began his career in the late 1940's, covering the fashion and social events with Eugenia Sheppard for the Herald Tribune. He then went to London and worked with Ernestine Carter doing the same for the Sunday Times. He also created eye-catching posters for Broadway shows and portraits for many celebrities, including Miles Davis, Marlene Dietrich, Diana Vreeland and later the Supremes and Liza Minelli. \n He says \"I was considered the fastest pencil in the field, a mannequin need only do her turn down the catwalk at a fashion show, and voila - an illustration.\" His admirers rightly believe that Eula's dynamic impressionistic watercolours capture the essence of a designer's collection far more effectively than the standard catwalk photographs. \n   Returning to America in the 1960's, he shared a studio with photographer Milton Greene, collaborating on covers, news and fashion stories for Life Magazine. Their partnership ended in 1968, after which Eula designed sets and costumes for the New York City Ballet, which was under the direction of George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins. He also worked very extensively with the designer Halston for many years. In the 70's, he diversified into television, directing \"fashion specials\" for movie stars such as Lauren Bacall and Candice Bergen. He won a Tony award for his work on the Broadway production of \"Private Lives\" in 1968. Joe contributed a great many illustrations for American Vogue. Later in the 1970's, he assisted Diana Vreeland, who was appointed head of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York in 1971. In 1979, Joe Eula signed an exclusive contract with Italian and French Harper's Bazaar, for fashion illustrations. In the 1980's, he handled the fashion illustration for such houses as Missoni Knitwear, Chanel, Givenchy, Versace, Karl Lagerfeld, Yves St. Laurent and many others. When he is reporting on international fashion shows, Eula manages with a few rapid strokes of his paintbrush, to reproduce the line, colour and cut of an outfit in the short time that it takes for a model to parade down the catwalk. Another of Joe's activities for some time, has been the cover designs, artworks and illustrations for music CD albums for such artistes as Liza Minelli and many others. Joe Eula, is a familiar figure at the international collections, frenziedly sketching as the models saunter down the catwalk. His is still the fastest pencil at the shows. Joe Eula's tribute to Yves St. Laurent in March 2002, on the great French designer's retirement, was published in the magazine of the Sunday New York Times in March 2002. Joe was there for YSL's first show for Dior in the early 1950's and he was there for YSL's last show in 2002. He has been drawing fashion for 55 years.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"John Anthony","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/john-anthony\/"],"biography":"Born in 1942 Gianantonio Iorio in Queens, New York, to a metalworker, John Anthony has evolved into a dress designer who uses the most luxurious fabrics in the simplest shapes with unequalled taste. His father was an Italian-American sculptor. While attending the High School of Industrial Arts, he was awarded a scholarship to the Accademia d'Arte in Rome, Italy. He spent several years in Italy, studying art, then returned to New York, and joined the Fashion Institute of Technology, in New York, graduating in 1959. He married Mollie and had a son named Mark. \n Anthony started his career working for 9 years (1959-1968) at Devonbrook Sportswear and then from 1968 to 1970 for Adolphe Zelinka. \n John Anthony started his own firm on Seventh Avenue, New York in 1971. His first collection was an edited Marlene Dietrich look, featuring masculine tailoring in pinstripe and herringbone wools, softened with blouses underneath, or pleated and smocked crepe dresses. He also presented pleated and smocked crepe dresses. His meticulously crafted collections have earned him a reputation for being one of fashion's most talented minimalists. \n   By 1976, he was showing the soft, liquid separates that became his trademark; ice cream colors seemed to melt into clothes that were so light they almost floated. Anthony believes designing clothes is a fusion of function and purpose. The function appears to be his logical, wearable approach; the purpose lies in his pared-down minimalist ideas. He edits collections down to their bare essentials and, while other designers often show over 100 styles per collection, he makes his statement in half this number. Within a year of opening his own ready-to-wear company, John Anthony won a Coty Fashion Award. He won his second in 1976. In the 1980's, he preferrered the smaller, more intimate scale of working directly with their clients. Anthony took 2 years off from 1984 to 1986, then opened a new atelier on 66th Street in 1986. One of the favourite evening silhouettes of the 1980's was the bustier topped short evening dress in a taffeta version from 1988. Anthony's masterpieces have traditionally sold in the higher-end marketplace, with a coat going for $6,000, a suit for $8,000, and an evening gown for $20,000, but the line he released in 2001 featured sizes up to 16 and the price tags range from $1,800 to $5,000, putting his works within reach of the average upper middle-class consumer.","the_look":"His clothing was luxurious, tailored as it had been in the 70's but interpreted in opulent materials, like wool trimmed with fur or silk embroidered overall in intricately beaded geometric patterns.\nHis subtle, understated clothes are designed for a young, sophisticated woman. He uses natural fabrics like wool, crepe, chiffon, jersey, satin, and menswear fabrics. He is particularly noted for his cardigan sweaters or pullovers, teamed with skirts and his elegant gala evening gowns, in contradictory daywear fabrics.\nHe believes the color palette in a collection should intermingle, so one item can easily go with everything else. His first collection was predominantly black with white, navy, and red. He claims to hate shock colors like turquoise or fuschia, and has usually been faithful to a range of beiges, christened with names such as peanut and cinnamon.","who_wears_it":["Betty Ford","Rosalynn Carter","Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis","Performers Lena Horne","Audrey Meadows","and Julie Andrews"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

Since then, he has had a number of shops in West London and is currently based in Beauchamp Place. \n Boyd has been a favourite hat designer for the royal family for many years - he has been designing Princess Anne's hats since she was 16 years old. \n So it was a natural choice for Diana, Princess of Wales to turn to John Boyd when she needed chic hats. He made the famous pink tricorn hat shown, that she wore with her going away outfit, after the wedding in 1981.

He sold his first drawing at the age of nine. He sold drawings to the original Life magazine at 15, and was hired as the sports cartoonist for the Salt Lake City Tribune when he was 16. \n In his teens he studied art briefly with sculptor Mahonri Young. In 1912, at the age of 23 John Held went East to New York. He spent the early days doing advertisements and trying to break into the magazine market. In 1915 he started appearing in Vanity Fair and in 1917, in House and Garden. In 1921 he drew for Century Magazine and in 1925 for the new magazine called The New Yorker. \n   His most famous and well-known drawings appeared on the cover of the original LIFE magazine. John Held's cartoons WERE the Jazz Age. His \"flapper\" summed up the whole decade. It seemed as if the fun would never end. But when the Stock Market crashed in 1929 and long skirts came in during the 1930's, John's drawings seemed out of date and not interesting. He continued to do commercial artwork throughout the 1930's and published several books, but it wasn't until the end of the decade that he again reached the top. In 1937 he did the sets for \"Hellzapoppin\" a very successful Broadway show. In 1939 Held exhibited sculpture, small bronze horses which was some of his most heartfelt work. In 1940 he became artist-in-residence at Harvard and the University of Georgia. 1942 was one of the happiest years of his life. He made a happy third marriage to Margaret (Maggie) Schuyler. He had been married twice before, from 1918 to 1931 to Ada Johnson, from 1932 to 1935 to beauty queen Gladys Moore, but both these marriages ended in divorce. During World War II, John and Maggie worked for the U.S. Signal Corps. After the war, Held found himself \"rediscovered\" and his drawings and woodcuts began to be shown in galleries. He was becoming important again. One of his most popular books was \"Held's Angels\" published in 1952.

The Paris store Colette liked his clothes so much that they asked Takahashi to present his 1998 collection \"Exchange\" in their store. He is now married with a beautiful wife and a baby daughter, and lives in Paris for most of his time. To introduce with AW 1999 collection \"Ambivalence\" he presented reversible clothes and had twins walk down, each wearing the same garment but one inside-out. Both versions were infinitely wearable. Pieces like a denim jacket that reverses to a nylon windbreaker, or a pair of nylon drawstring pants that turn inside out to become cargo trousers, were funny and street-inspired. A casual denim jacket turned into an elegant fur dress, another amazing design consisted of a pair of pants which could be worn as a skirt on the reverse.

{"designer_name":"Joseph Leyendecker","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/joseph-leyendecker\/"],"biography":"Joseph Leyendecker was born to Peter and Elizabeth Ortsifen Leyendecker in 1874, in Montabaur, Germany. The family included Adolph aged 12, August aged 10, Joseph aged 8 and Franz (Frank) aged 4. (Frank Xavier Leyendecker also grew up to be a great illustrator. \n In July 1882, the whole family emigrated to New York, USA, and eventually settled in Chicago, sponsored by Elizabeth's brother who worked for a brewery there. Frank and Joseph both displayed artistic talent. Frank joined Carl Brandt as an apprentice to learn how to do stained glass work. Joseph went to study at the Julian Academy and became a pupil of Benjamin Constant and Jean-Paul Laurens. \n In 1896 the family decided that Joseph was the artistic genius and scraped together enough money to send him to Paris to study art. Frank, his younger brother went along although it was hard to tell which brother did the paintings. They both attended the Academy Julien and were considered to be talented. They returned to America in 1898 and opened a studio in Chicago. \n   In 1898, Joseph won a Century Magazine cover competition that brought his work to national notice. This led to cover assignments like Inland Printer, for whom he did all 12 of their covers for 1897. This work was produced in Paris, so Joe and his brother Frank went to Paris in the autumn of 1896. While he was there he spent some time studying at the Academie Julian. He also showed his work at the 1897 Salon Camp de Mars, his first major exhibition of paintings. In the fall of 1898, the brothers returned to America and opened a studio in Chicago. Joseph was soon working for national publications like Colliers and the Saturday Evening Post. In 1900 they opened a studio in New York. From there, he poured forth an amazing quantity of illustrations, covers and advertisements. Thereafter, for several years, he illustrated covers for the Saturday Evening Post, Collier's Weekly and other magazines. After achieving fame through his Chesterfield cigarette advertisements, he was hired in 1905 by the Arrow collar and shirt company in Troy, New York, to illustrate their publicity material. His work was so true-to-life that women were convinced that his characters (clean-cut upstanding young Americans) were portraits of real people. The advertisements he illustrated, provoked the kind of fan mail a pop star might receive today. Although Arrow were specialists in men's shirts, Leyandecker's drawings helped the shape of women's blouses to evolve, based on the women shown in his sketches. For nearly 40 years, he contributed regular illustrations to the Saturday Evening Post up to 1943, when the editorship changed and the new editor felt Leyandecker was too much associated with the old magazine. The American Weekly hired him in 1945 to do covers. He had completed more than half a century of illustration work. While he was working on a Weekly cover, in 1951, he had a heart attack and died. He was 77 years old.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

His grandmother on the other side of the family was a lingerie seamstress and corset maker: she instilled in him the importance of always producing your best work. \n   Then, there was his father, an optician, from whom he learned about accessories and innovative shapes. He started drawing at the age of three, but the artist in him was subsumed for a short time with his triumph in science, choosing to study medicine when he entered the university at 18. But, his art won out in the end. Two years into training in medicine, (after a degree in Biology), he opted for fashion, continuing his studies at the Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale Couture Parisienne, from where he graduated in 2000. On his graduation day, Paris Fashion 2000 awarded him with the Moet & Chandon Prize for best accessories. During those three years of study and the necessary apprenticeship that followed, he worked at several fashion houses to develop his skills. He learned the tricks of the trade hands on from the House of Nina Ricci and at Christian Dior where he worked on accessories with Jean Mouclier; and at Givenchy, working alongside Christina Zeller, he helped develop a haute couture collection of bags, jeweller and accessories.

{"designer_name":"Jean Schlumberger","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/jean-schlumberger\/"],"biography":"Jean Schlumberger was a French jewelry designer especially well-known for his work at Tiffany & Co. \n On June 24, 1907 Schlumberger was born in Mulhouse, France to a well-to-do family involved in textile manufacturing. He sketched constantly during his youth, but his parents tried to discourage his artistic interest by refusing to allow him to undertake formal training. Schlumberger began his career creating buttons for Elsa Schiaparelli in the 1930s. Schiaparelli later commissioned him to design costume jewelry for her firm. \n During World War II, Schlumberger was in the French Army and survived Dunkirk. He also served under General Charles de Gaulle in England and the Middle East with the Free French Forces. \n   After the war, Schlumberger came to New York and began to design clothing for Chez Ninon. In 1946, he opened a jewelry salon with partner Nicolas Bongard (1908-2000). In 1956, the president of Tiffany & Co., Walter Hoving, asked Schlumberger to begin designing for the firm. He had his own workshop at the company until his retirement in the late 1970s and was eventually made a Vice-President. Schlumberger's designs at Tiffany & Co. were remarkable for their whimsical interpretations of natural forms. He was especially inspired by sea creatures and other animals. Diana Vreeland wrote that Schlumberger \"appreciates the miracle of jewels. For him, they are the ways and means to the realization of his dreams.\" He was a very good friend of Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga, Emilio Terry, Diana Vreeland and Hubert de Givenchy. One of the most famous pieces that Schlumberger created was the mounting for the famed Tiffany Diamond, which was in the firm's collection since the nineteenth century. The brooch, entitled \"Bird on a Rock\", incorporates the impressive 128.54 carats (25.71 g) yellow diamond in a fanciful setting typical of Schlumberger's style. Schlumberger died in Paris (August 29, 1987)  and is buried at Isola di San Michele. Schlumberger remains one of only four jewelers that Tiffany & Co. has allowed to sign their work: the others are Paloma Picasso, Elsa Peretti and Frank Gehry.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["He quickly built an impressive client base that included John F.

A Jew, she escaped the Holocaust of World War II to the safety of the Swiss house when her father was able to obtain a Swiss schutzpass, a document that gave the bearer safe passage. This pass is on view at the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC. \n After the war, she began making handbags at home and then at a friend's small factory. She met and married an American soldier, Gerson Leiber, and emigrated to the United States in 1948. \n   After working as a handbag designer for other companies, Leiber founded her own business in 1963. Sold at exclusive boutiques around the world, her handbags cost several thousand dollars and have become a status symbol for many women including several Presidential First Ladies. Leiber is most famous for her minaudieres, which are often covered in crystals. Animals are a recurring theme, and often the most expensive purses of the collection with prices on some animal shaped minaudieres exceeding $5000. A Judith Leiber cupcake minaudiere was featured in the Sex and the City movie. The Judith Leiber boutiques are exclusive as there are only four in the United States, located in Las Vegas (2 locations), Orange County, and New York City. A fifth location was located in Atlanta, but closed in 2008 due to leasing issues. A biography of Leiber and her husband, modernist artist Gergson Leiber, was published in 2010. Entitled No Mere Bagatelles, it was written by Jeffrey Sussman. Mr. Sussman has also written the catalogue copy for numerous exhibitions at the Leiber Museum. Exhibitions for which he has written the catalogues include one for Judith Leiber's handbags, one for an exhibition of antique Chinese porcelains, and one for the print work of the American artist Will Barnet. In 1994, Leiber received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers. Classic examples of her work can be found on permanent display at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia has had a gallery of her work on display since it opened in 2008. She retired in 1998. In September 2008, Leiber was rated the most prestigious luxury handbag brand for the second year running by the New York-based Luxury Institute.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/judithleiberny","brands":["Judith Leiber"]}

{"designer_name":"Jacques Fath","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/jacques-fath\/"],"biography":"Jacques Fath was a French fashion designer who was considered one of the three dominant influences on postwar haute couture, the others being Christian Dior and Pierre Balmain. \n Fath was born in 1912 in Laffitte, France into a Protestant family of Flemish and Alsatian origin. His father wanted Jacques to join him in the insurance brokerage business, and for a while Jacques worked as a bookkeeper at the Paris Bourse, and later, briefly, as a broker. But there was too much of the artist in Jacques\u2019 genetic pool for brokerage work to be completely satisfying. His great-grandmother was a dressmaker who was very popular during the time of Empress Eugenie, the great beauty and consort of Napoleon III. Jacques\u2019 great-grandfather was a writer, and his grandfather a landscape painter. From early childhood Jacques wanted to be a dress designer. He often criticized his elder sister\u2019s clothing. This blond-haired young child had been born with a heightened artistic sensibility. \n After two years working at the Paris Bourse, Jacques took his required one year of military training. As soon as Jacques returned to civilian life, he furiously prepared for his career as a couturier. Fath was entirely self-taught; he threw himself into studying designs, studying costumes, studying fashion, going to museums and reading books. \n   Fath presented his first collection in 1937, working out of a two room salon on Rue de la Boetie. The studio was later moved to a second location on Rue Francois Premier in 1940 before settling into a third location at 39 Avenue Pierre 1er de Serbie in 1944. Among his models was Lucie Daouphars (1921 or 1922\u20131963), a.k.a. Lucky, a former welder who eventually become the top house model for Christian Dior. As self-taught designer who learned his craft from studying museum exhibitions and books about fashion, Fath hired a number of young designers as assistants and apprentices, some of which later went on to form their own houses, including Hubert de Givenchy, Guy Laroche, and Valentino Garavani. Parisian couturier Jacques Fath was known for his designs that glorified the female figure. In 1948, Fath signed an agreement with American manufacturer Joseph Halpert to produce a line of Made in America ready-to-wear clothing for women in the U.S. The line was carried in high end department stores like Lord & Taylor, Bonwit Teller, Julius Garfinkle, and Hudson's. Fath died of leukemia on November 13, 1954. Approximately 4,000 people attended his funeral at St. Pierre de Chaillot Church in Paris. Fath was the subject of a 1994 documentary film by Pascal Franck called Les Folies de Fath.","the_look":"Fath was known for his hourglass shapes, plunging necklines, tiny waists and full skirts.  It has been suggested that Fath even inspired Dior's New Look. Certainly, Fath designed some of the sexiest and most glamorous dresses to come out of Paris. A Fath dress would often feature a molded bodice that would show off a slender waist and emphasize the bosom and hips. He favored irregular necklines and often drew attention to cleavage. His skirts were either very slim or very full, characterized by a myriad of pleating or draping.\nFath worked directly with the fabric, draping it on his models. Fath's style was best known for its glamour. He often used diagonal lines, asymmetrical draping, and floating panels to give a sense of movement. Angled collars and pockets, slanted or zigzagging skirts, bustles or fans jutting out from tight dresses, tucks, tiers and knife pleats all added to the unique quality of his clothes. He had a great sense of color, often using combinations such as bright blues and greens. Fath's glamorous style had a wide appeal, and in 1948 he signed an agreement with the American manufacturer, Joseph Halpert. Henceforth, in addition to his own couture collections, Fath produced a low-priced American line as well.","who_wears_it":["Ava Gardner","Greta Garbo","and Rita Hayworth"],"perfumes":["1953 Fath de Fath (W)","1993 Green Water (M)","1996 Yang Imperial (M)","1996 Yin Imperial (W)","1998 Fath Pour L`Homme (M)","1999 Yin (W)","1999 Yang (M)","2009 Jacques Fath Irissime (W)","2010 Eau de Fath (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Jacques Fath"]}

Obsessed with baseball caps, he could never find one that was well designed - with quality construction, shape, fabric and coloring. In 1991, James set out to make the ideal cap for Maxfield and it was not long before customers became clients - film directors ordered hats for their cast and crew and record labels bought them for tours. \n It is his excessive taste for minimalist architecture which encouraged James Perse to create in 1994 his own line of tee-shirts which will be completed two years later by a complete collection of ready-to-wear clothing with elegant and comfortable design.

After creating one for Stephanie of Monaco after a chance meeting, Jean Claude Jitrois left psychology behind and began a new career as a fashion designer, opening his first boutique in 1976 in Nice on the rue Tondutil de l\u2019Escarene. \n He considered fashion as a language where bodies, very much like in dancing, communicate through a system of signs that can vary and be modified, and a basis on which to work. Jean \u2013 Claude Jitrois realized that it was possible to adapt a lot of elements of his theory and of his therapeutic practice to Couture. His first intuition, his vision of fashion was that clothes were like a second skin, a second self, a non \u2013 verbal language within the social body. Jean Claude Jitrois simply changed his activity, but he surely did not change his trade. \n   Going from strength to strength, anotherJitrois boutique soon followed in the town of Juan-les-Pins, near Antibes and then another in St. Tropez. Quickly establishing himself within the influential circles on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, he continued to design for the royal family of Monaco, for both St\u00e9phanie and her sister Caroline. In 1980 he created a complete bath robe for Brigitte Bardot. This marks the start of a new period of designing for Jean Claude, as he launched his first leather line, J3 in 1981, which included his first men\u2019s wear line. The success that followed resulted in the first Parisian boutique in 1983, opening on the world famous rue Faubourg Saint Honor\u00e9, the Rodeo Drive of Paris. Well-respected in the fashion circle, Jean Claude Jitrois already has an assured place in fashion history when he revolutionized the leather industry in 1995 when he launched the first stretch leather in the world. Over the years, Jitrois has continued to push the physical properties of the oldest material worn by man. Combining state of the art technology, Jitrois has created leather garments that go far beyond normal expectations of leather. In 1998, Jitrois opened a new boutique on the prestigious Sloane Street in London, followed by one in Puerto Banus in Spain and then one in Cannes, on the Croisette. In 2002 Jean Claude Jitrois received the \u2018L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur\u2019, the highest decoration in France for services to the fashion industry and the promotion of France abroad.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Cher","Elton John","Ke$ha","Liz Hurley","Beyonce","Mary J Blige","Lady Gaga"],"perfumes":["1988 Jitrois (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Jitrois"]}

He signed his first creations in 1791. On August 1, 1793, he joined forces with Jacques-Dauphin Moulini\u00e9, under the corporate name Moulini\u00e9 & Bautte, case fitters. On October 1, 1804, with the arrival of Jean-Gabriel Moynier, the firm became Moulini\u00e9, Bautte & Cie, seller of watch making-jewellery making. It was then that Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bautte developed his own manufacture in Geneva that brought together under the same roof all the bodies of trades of watch making from that time. He died on November 30, 1837 and was buried in Plainpalais Cemetery in Geneva. \n The workshops of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bautte were grouped around the sales shop situated on Rue du Rh\u00f4ne.

In 1962 the brothers opened a hairdressing salon in the King\u2019s Road, being joined two years later by their other brother, Franklin. At this time he was already intensely interested in fashion, and began to display a few choice items from designers he admired, such as Kenzo, Emmanuelle Khanh, and Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, alongside the hairdryers. Then, in the 1970s, he opened his first shop, in Sloane Street, Knightsbridge. \n He had no background in fashion, but he did have a good eye and a knack for retailing. He also believed in giving women what they wanted \u2013 in the King's Road salon he had made a particular point of identifying this. \n   His first store was designed by Norman Foster, it offered monochrome decor and predominantly black stock, and was soon a destination of a fashionable clientele from around the world. Soon, too, designers and pioneers of style were keen to be showcased in his stores. At Joseph Pour la Maison, for example, he introduced the work of figures such as the home stylist Maryse Boxer and the Czech architect and designer Eva Jiricna \u2013 the latter helped Joseph to style several of his homes. Joseph is credited with revolutionising knitwear, investing it with a new and understated chic. Meanwhile, during the economic downturn of the early 1990s he came up with the low-cut, narrow-legged Joseph trousers that were an immediate hit with fashionable women. From small beginnings in the 1960s he established shops across the world, among them more than 20 stores in London, four in New York and four in Paris. There were also shops in Leeds and Mancheste. In 2005 Joseph (as chairman of the business) and his brother Franklin (as chief operating officer) shared more than L20 million when the chain was sold to a Japanese clothing company for L140 million. They had sold the majority of their equity in 1999 to a consortium of Belgian and French investors, with Joseph personally making just over L30 million from the sale. In 1998 he bought Connolly, the leather company famous for designing the interiors of Jaguars and where his wife, Isabel, had been creative director.

A denim lover at heart, Trotzuk combines his love for fashion, rock n\u2019 roll, and classic American blue jeans, and applies it toward his passion, denim design. \n Trotzuk, who stills calls Vancouver home, even when constantly traveling and working with clients in NYC, LA, Montreal, and Toronto, has known for a long time that he was destined to be a denim designer. \n Trotzuk, who grew up during the influx of denim, started to make statements of his own. At 18 years of age, he was hand-painting old Levi's jeans and selling them on Vancouver's Robson Street for a couple hundred bucks a pop. The painting evolved into sewing and the pants branched out into denim jackets, and soon Trotzuk was making rock-star-worthy gear adorned in velvet flames and lace trim: one-of-a-kind pieces that stood out from the rest. \n   The custom jeans carried Trotzuk through college, until he left to pursue the budding interest the market had in the motorcycle T-shirts he was creating, an item that he says got him into the fashion industry. But by age 30, the designer was \"down and out,\" and in need of business. He approached a local retailer in hopes of such a break, and was handed a pair of board shorts and asked to produce hundreds more. Most recognized as creator and visionary of many successful clothing lines, Trotzuk turned down design offers from premium denim companies after he parted ways with his former business partners in his most recent brand preceding FIDELITY. He chose instead to develop his own concept premium denim brand and recognized what women wanted in their jeans: great fabric, finishes, and fit and with those elements they would be loyal, trusting, and devoted customers. With his intimate knowledge of denim history and tradition, Trotzuk ingeniously references and revives the best of denim from the inside out\u2014straight waistbands, busted out seams, dual stitch color, and aged hardware. The result? The look and feel of timeless vintage jeans, but with a highly crafted modern understanding of a woman\u2019s needs.

He was born in 1974 and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. In his early age he rode the Italian \u201cVogue\u201d between classes and wrote about fashion in French essays. Scott attended the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, for fashion design. After his graduation, the 21-year-old Scott made a pilgrimage to Paris where his collection, made out of paper hospital gowns and inspired by the body-modifying artist Orlan, would go down in fashion folklore. And his first formal runway presentation in October 1997, \u2018Rich White Women\u2019, presenting asymmetrically cut trousers and multifunctional T-shirts, would establish Scott as a considerable Paris presence. But controversy clings to the designer like a Pierre Cardin teddy bear brooch \u2013 later collections, such as March 1998\u2019s infamous \u2018Contrapied\u2019 show, have met with a mixture of incredulity, derision and bemusement, all the while establishing key details of the Scott aesthetic; attention to volume, an obsession with logos (including the best-selling back-to-front Paris print), a hard-edged Mugler-esque glamour and a wicked way with fur. \n His collection brought him international fashion recognition, winning the Venus de la Mode Award for \u201cBest Designer of the Year\u201d in both 1996 and 1997. By 1999, Scott was recognized by the CFDA and was nominated for \u201c Best Young Designer.\u201d \n In Autumn 2001, Scott relocated to Los Angeles, a city that has welcomed his \u00fcber-trash, parodic style with wide-open arms.

Dissatisfied with the literature studies prescribed by his traditional innkeeper parents, he went to Tokyo, where he worked as a house painter and took evening classes in studio art. \n In 1958 he joined the predominantly female student body of the Bunka Gakuen School of Fashion. In 1960 he won a Japanese fashion award, the prestigious Soen prize. He began working for the Sanai department store as a designer of girl's clothing, making up to 40 styles every month. \n   In 1964 Kenzo moved to Paris. He took some time to settle in, but eventually he started sketching. The revolutionary new outfits by Courreges were the inspiration for a series of 30 designs he made, 5 of which were accepted by designer Louis Feraud. Over the next few years, he worked for various departmental stores, the Pisanti textile group and Relations Textiles. In 1970 Kenzo took over a former antique clothing store in disrepair and painted it himself. Then cutting and sewing a collection of his own designs, he took them round to the fashion magazines. By November he had moved to 28 passages Choiseul and almost immediately his clothes started attracting notice. A boutique in the Galeria Vivienne gave him the chance to introduce his own style to Parisiennes. He opened his own boutique called \"Jungle Jap\" selling loose casual clothes, smock tent dresses, and huge striped dungarees with elephant legs. He enlarged armholes and changed the shoulder shape and introduced 100% cotton fabrics. In 1971 Jungle Jap designs were featured in American Vogue as the next development in the Paris boutique scene. In 1972 Kenzo's show at the Gare d'Orsay was very successful. In 1975 his first collections were shown in Tokyo. In 1977 he presented his collections in New York. In 1978 he became known as the \"Great White designer\" although his designs were very colourful indeed and his styles amazingly diverse. In 1979 his collection was shown in Zurich for the first time. In 1990 Kenzo's empire expanded to included menswear, jeans, children's wear and other products. In October 1999, Kenzo presented his final show, handing over the design to Giles Rosier. Kenzo had sold his house to the Luxury group LVMH run by Bernard Arnault. However Kenzo Takada himself has no plans to disappear. At a lunch with the press in May 2002, he outlined his plans. He has started up a label called \"Yume\" (Japanese for Dream) which will include a series of men and women's apparel and accessories, as well as bed linen with Japanese motifs for La Redoute, Europe's biggest mail order group, owned by Francois Pinault. In late 2003, it was announced that Antonio Marras, the Italian designer would be the new Artistic Director for Kenzo.

{"designer_name":"Karl Ottolagerfeld","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/karl-ottolagerfeld\/"],"biography":"  Karl Otto Lagerfeld was born September 10, 1938 in Hamburg, Germany of a Scandinavian dairy magnate and his German wife. \n He is widely recognized as one of the most influential fashion designers of the late twentieth century. He made his name as an independent creator who collaborated with a variety of different fashion labels, including Chloe, Fendi and Chanel. \n   In the early 1980s he set up his own label, called Lagerfeld, which launched perfumes and clothing lines. He has also played a role in equipping leading artists. His father, Christian Lagerfeld, was a member of a Swedish merchant-banking family and made his fortune introducing powdered milk to Germany. His mother, Elizabeth, was German. Lagerfeld was their only child, born 10 years after the couple's marriage, when his mother was 42 and his father 60. He has several half-siblings from his parents' previous marriages. He afterwards said that when he was 12 years old, he spent 3 hours a day learning French. He said his mother told him that Hamburg was only a door for him. In 1952 at the age of 14, he came to Paris to study, but he says that he spent most of his time in the studios of the artists who thronged Paris in the 50's and with such men as Jean Cocteau and Jean-Paul Sartre. With a passion for drawing, Karl studied history of costume. He would amuse himself by re-interpreting styles of various periods. In 1954 he saw huge posters all over Paris inviting sketches to be sent to the International Wool Secretariat, for a competition for designs in various categories. He sent in some sketches for coats, and 6 months later, he heard by telegram that he had won the coat category. Yves St. Laurent won the dress category in the same competition. Pierre Balmain was one of the judges, and he immediately hired the talented young Karl Lagerfeld. He stayed there for 3.1\/2 years. Karl still has many of the friends he made at Balmain, and a number of them work with him today. In everyone's opinion Karl was extremely gifted and destined for a brilliant future. In 1958 at the age of 20 Karl became Art Director at the famous house of Jean Patou - designing two haute couture collections a year. In 1962 Karl Lagerfeld signed with the largest departmental store in Japan, ISETAN, to create fashion collections for men and women. In 1963 Karl left Patou and started free-lance designing in Italy and France. Around that time, the idea of pret-a-porter (ready-to-wear) was born. A sort of simplified high fashion which anyone could do well. Karl offered his talents to several houses. His goal was to design clothes for as many diverse types of women as possible. Chloe was a house formed in 1952 which made very feminine garments. Karl joined them and within a short while gained a reputation for the house for lightness and youthfulness. His ensembles at Chloe are constructed of several light weight, airy layers, included camisoles, shirt-jackets and sleeveless jackets, used in different ways. Colours were ethereal as the thin silk itself and Lagerfeld experimented with many forms of decoration - painting silk in patterns, using inserts of lace, he tied silk blouses around the waist, wrapped scarves around the hips, made high collars to achieve a look called \"Byronesque.\" He continued making these beautiful clothes for 14 years until the Fall\/Winter 1997 collection, when he handed over the house to Stella MacCartney, daughter of singer Paul McCartney who has brought out her first collection for Chloe, Summer 1998. In 1963 Karl Lagerfeld met the women who were to play an enormous role in his life and his career, the 5 Roman women, Queens of top quality furs, the Fendi sisters. They asked him to take over the design of their collections and little by little, they became his second family. Several times a year, he comes to work with them in Rome. He has gradually expanded their product line to include dresses, handbags, luggage, belts, accessories and many other products. In 1975 Karl started Parfum Lagerfeld, a company which produces and markets perfumes such as Chloe, Lagerfeld for men and K.L. His memories of special scents from his childhood was the inspiration. In 1983, Karl Lagerfeld was given the artistic direction of Chanel at a time when the name had been largely forgotten, remembered only for it's perfumes. He brought new life back into Chanel's shops. The most experienced and talented hands in Paris measured, cut, draped, sewed and embroidered the most expensive garments in the world. The meeting of 2 extraordinary talents, Coco Chanel and Karl Lagerfield, has from the very first collection, been a sensation. He has kept to the overall classic lines of Chanel yet updated the added a sparkle to the old house. He did show a lack of respect for Coco when he exposed the one part of the body she hated to reveal - the knee - but his new high hemlines were a smash hit. In 1984 Karl Lagerfeld started his own label, and from then on presented 2 collections a year as solely Karl Lagerfeld creations. This has continued inspite of all the other collections he creates. In the late 80's, he took up the design of porcelain for the West German pottery firm Hutchenrehter and has also found time to continue to design for films and the theatre, as well as neckwear and eyewear for all his contracts. In 1986 he launched an American Sportswear line, a semi-annual collection with an American point of view. In 1987 Karl Lagerfeld was awarded the Golden Thimble the Fashion Industry's highest honour, for the collection of the year. Karl Lagerfeld now designs more than 20 collections a year. In 2001 we are seeing a new slimmer Karl, with an impressive weight loss. This slimline image is the inspiration for his new line of denim. Using his own label, he has collaborated with Diesel on a range of styles to flatter the fit physique. He also has a hobby of buying and renovating old houses. He is a specialist of the 18th century and considered an expert by the most important antique dealers in the world. Although he is extremely busy, he always takes the time to see houses and give his opinion on antiques, or buy another of his masterpieces. Among his many talents, Karl is a stamp designer. The French post office has issued two of his designs for 2004 featuring the square Channel No. 5 perfume bottle. Recently, Lagerfeld collaborated with the international Swedish fashion brand H&M. On the 12 November 2004 H&M offered a limited range of different clothes in chosen outlets for both women and men. Only two days after having supplied their outlets, H&M announced that all clothes were almost sold out. Lagerfeld has expressed he does not fear working with lower-end brands will taint his image. Lagerfeld did not did not take his traditional final bow at the end of Chanel's couture show on 22 January 2019 at the Grand Palais in Paris and instead sent Virginie Viard (who will now succeed him) in his place. He was last seen in public in November, when the Christmas lights were lit on the Champs-Elysees. He passed away on February 19, 2019 after being taken to hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine just outside Paris the night before. He was 85.","the_look":"Lagerfeld is known for his versatility and for expertly juggling his roles in various labels.

Previously, Kenneth Cole had considered the design of women's shoes to be the most unmasculine career imaginable, but he relented and joined his father in a business called Candies in 1976. He soon learned that the instant gratification of the trade was fulfilling. Within a matter of weeks his designs were rendered into wearable finished products. During the early 1970s their company began importing French and Italian shoes, which led to the fortune they made on \"slides,\" an inexpensive backless sandal with a wedge heel and colored beads strung on a leather strand. \n In 1982, in order to get his shoes in front of the public, he parked a large truck in midtown Manhattan and pretended to shoot a film called \"Birth of a Shoe Company\". He sold 40,000 pairs of shoes in two and a half days. He was off and running. \n In the mid 1980's, he married Maria Cuomo, of the famous New York political family the Cuomos. They have a teenage daughter Amanda. He and his family live in a Stanford White-designed Westchester home. \n   Kenneth has built a fashion empire out of tailored classics with sharp accents, and he's done it from the shoes up. His womenswear is engaging and informally chic. His pantsuit outfits, coats, dresses and sportswear are the ultimate favourites for New York women. Kenneth Cole presented his Spring\/Summer 2003 collection at Bryant Park, during the New York Fashion Week in September 2002, which was much admired. Kenneth is getting ready to launch his home line of table-top groupings and accessories for the home. It should be available in the better stores in February 2006.","the_look":"Casual urban sophisticate who doesn\u2019t mind walking ten blocks to Soho.","who_wears_it":["Lisa Kudrow","Teri Hatcher","Britney Spears","Vanessa Williams"],"perfumes":["2002 Kenneth Cole (W)","2002 Kenneth Cole (M)","2002 Stir the Air (W)","2002 Stir the Air (M)","2003 Black (M)","2003 White (W)","2004 Reaction (M)","2005 Signature (M)"],"social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kennethcole","brands":["Kenneth Cole","Kenneth Cole New York","Kenneth Cole Reaction"]}

{"designer_name":"Koos Van Den Akker","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/koos-van-den-akker\/"],"biography":"Koos van den Akker was born in 1939, in the Hague, Netherlands. In 1955 he studied at the Royal Academy of Art in the Hague. \n His first work in fashion was with Christian Dior in Paris, but he returned to Holland and opened his own boutique, around 1960. \n In 1968, carrying a portable sewing machine, he moved to the USA and set up a temporary shop on a Manhattan pavement, which attracted a great deal of attention. His first designs were quilted garments with inserts of lace. \n   By 1970 he had opened the first of several stores in New York city. Taking his inspiration from fabric, Van den Akker created clothes that are highly individual and boldly coloured, using collage and patchwork. Selling his own custom-made dresses in a boutique gained van den Akker enough experience to open a Madison Avenue shop, one in Beverly Hills, and a men's boutique during the 1970s. In 1983 he presented a moderately priced collection, Hot House. By 1986 he was designing lingerie, daytime and evening clothes, furs, sheets, and home furnishings. Women's clothes were made of beautiful fabrics with colorful print and lace inserts, sometimes following the lines of the garments in harmony and balance, other times contrasting shapes versus line. Van den Akker's moment has again come, his dresses from decades ago are being worn by Hollywood celebrities to important occasions. He is also making new designs today, using his signature collage and appliqu\u00e9 techniques. To adoring fans of his designs, van den Akker sold all of his fall-winter 1998 collection in 27 minutes. Finding homes in closets were a big shirt, reversible silk jacket, bias patchwork skirt, pull-cord handbag, and comfy drawstring pants with cotton tee. Koos designs his Koos of Course line for QVC and is a favourite of customers, wearing his signature apron and dishing out fashion advice.","the_look":"Koos van den Akker is known for his painterly delight in mixing colors, patterns, and textures in unusual, often one of a kind, garments.\nSince his arrival in the United States in 1968 with just a sewing machine, he has been delighting clients who want something a bit different to wear. His styles have not changed much, simple shapes being more amenable to rich surface manipulations. Having learned the basics of good fit and cut as an apprentice with the house of Christian Dior, van den Akker was able to proceed confidently with the fabric collages that have become his signature. Although his Koos garments recall the art-to-wear movement, they remain free of the sometimes heavy-handed messages inherent in the artifacts which seem more suitable for gallery walls\u2014these masterpieces are meant to be worn and appreciated for their beauty.\nConservatively styled suits consisting of cardigan jackets and gored skirts might be covered with textured mixtures of fur, quilted fabric, leather strips, or pieces of wool. A dress of lace might be dramatized by bold appliqu\u00e9. As many as six materials might be combined in collages of cotton, wool, furs, tweeds, sequins, and leather. Some of the results are reminiscent of grandmother's crazy quilt, but all are carried out with a true designer's skill and artistic sensitivity. Indeed, van den Akker has admitted that the designs just flow, working themselves out through the process of creation, perhaps reflecting a hereditary affinity with Dutch national costume.\nIn late 1989 van den Akker showed the home-sewing public how to make their own creative clothing in a detailed article in Threads Magazine. The next year signaled a broadening of his range to include simpler ready-to-wear sportswear\u2014tweed dresses and coats, coats of blanket materials, matching suede jackets and skirts, and short floral dresses with just a hint of the Koos play with fabrics in a mixed-print collar. The designer continued to refine his artistry, developing a ready-to-wear sportswear collection for DeWilde that is more subtle and interchangeable. Toned-down collage effects and texture appliqu\u00e9s lend interest to classic pieces in wool and cashmere, even sheer georgette.\nThroughout the last months of the 20th century and into the 21st, while collectors were stocking their wardrobes with his past glories, van den Akker remained a fashion pacesetter. He served as one of four guest critics of future fashion designers at the Fashion Institute of Technology exhibit entitled White Noise. The 1999 segment of the spirited annual student show at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, interpreted the psychological concept of white noise with 30 garments for adults and children. Despite PETA's protests of his use of fur in coutourier collections, he, along with Oscar de la Renta and Valentino, continued to design for New York-based furrier Alixandre by applying broadtail, fox, lynx, mink, sable, and sheared beaver to winter fashions. Van den Akker's spring\/summer line for 2001 perpetuated his tradition of fabric collage and appliqu\u00e9d couture in softly draping shapes to flatter the figure.","who_wears_it":["Gloria Vanderbilt","Elizabeth Taylor","Cher","Barbara Walters","Glenn Close","Bill Cosby"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Klaus Martens","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/klaus-martens\/"],"biography":"Klaus M\u00e4rtens was a doctor in the German army during World War II. While on leave in 1945, he injured his ankle while skiing in the Bavarian Alps. He found that his standard-issue army boots were too uncomfortable on his injured foot. While recuperating, he designed improvements to the boots, with soft leather, and air-padded soles. When the war ended and some Germans looted valuables from their own cities, Maertens took leather from a cobbler's shop. With that leather he made himself a pair of boots with air-cushioned soles. \n M\u00e4rtens didn't have much luck selling his shoes until he met up with an old university friend, Dr. Herbert Funck, in Munich in 1947. Funck was intrigued by the new shoe design, and the two went into business that year in Seeshaupt, Germany, using discarded rubber from Luftwaffe airfields. The comfortable and durable soles were a big hit with housewives, with 80% of sales in the first decade going to women over the age of 40. \n Sales had grown so much by 1952 that they opened a factory in Munich. In 1959, the company had grown large enough that M\u00e4rtens and Funck looked at marketing the footwear internationally. Almost immediately, British shoe manufacturer R. Griggs Group Ltd. bought patent rights to manufacture the shoes in the United Kingdom. Griggs anglicized the name, slightly re-shaped the heel to make them fit better, added the trademark yellow stitching, and trademarked the soles as AirWair.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["The Bouncing Souls","punks"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

His first collection debuted in London in 1971 and in the USA at Hess's Department Store in Allentown, Pennsylvania, which was renowned for many avant-garde colletions. His 1975 debut in Paris was followed by the opening of his Kansai Boutique in 1977. \n   In 1999, he and Junko Koshino renewed the kimono, reviving interest in this classical fashion.

His silhouettes for both menswear and womenswear are extreme, suggesting either the most wondrous last samurai or the most magnificent first warriors for intergalactic futures; his appliqu\u00e9s have been in the ambiguous realm between primitive art and 20th-century abstraction.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kansai_yamamoto_official","brands":["Kansai"]}

Petr Baloun was a highly appreciated art blacksmith, whose works decorate many houses in Prague's Old Town, but also other places in the Czech Republic. After the years he spent in Canada you can see his works, for example, in the Kennedys' house in Palm Beach. \n A feeling for art, a strong will and the willingness to work hard, these are the features Katerina most likely inherited from her father. Creative talent together with a goal - to seek work - soon brought the first successes. Already in the course of her studies on the Academy of Design in Toronto, Katerina Baloun started to co-operate with one of the leading Canadian fashion designers, Pat McDonagh, who became famous for her costumes for the Beatles, Cher, and Princess Diana. Immediately after graduation Katerina worked with Toronto designer, Pino Tancredi, and also designed costumes for the Montreal and Toronto dance production \"Under Her Heart\" by the world-famous choreographer, Livia Daza - Paris. As a consultant she took part in the preparation of a video clip for the popular Canadian rock band Danko Jones for Much Music (a Canadian version of MTV). \n Shortly before her return to Europe and the foundation of her own trademark \"baloun\" she worked for Olio Studio in Toronto. The spring 2000 collection that Katerina Baloun presented during her \u201cVirtual Tribe\" show was an experimental combination of white and yellow plastics. Her futuristic conception of the woman's beauty in geometric shapes received an unexpected success and copies of Katerina\u00b4s models appeared even at the fashion shows of German designers. \n   In the year 2000, her sister's wedding and her design of her bridesmaids' dresses brought Katerina back to the Czech Republic and thus fulfilled her long-term desire to return home. Her first local activity was her co-operation with a French producer, Wilfred Prager, during the shooting of the film \"My Beautiful Demon\". Subsequently Katerina created a collection of mosaic dresses for the architect and designer Martin Sladky and his European premiere of the \"de.facto fashion show\" in the Schwarzenberg palace in Prague. Dresses from thin plates of 24 carats gold met well-deserved response. Katerina Baloun\u00b4s participation in many other fashion shows is for the time being topped by the \" Prague Fashion Days\" connected with the \"Look Model Of The Year\", where together with designers from all over the Europe Katerina presented her autumn 2002 collection.

{"designer_name":"Katharine Hamnett","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/katharine-hamnett\/"],"biography":"Katharine E. Hamnett is an English fashion designer best known for her political t-shirts and her ethical business philosophy. \n Katharine Eleanor Appleton was born on 16 August 1947. With a father in the R.A.F she lives in France, Sweden, Romania and England and attended ten different schools including Cheltenham Ladies College. \n From 1964 to 1965 she studied fashion at Konstfackskolan Stockholm. \n   From 1965 to 1975 he studied BA Fashion and Textiles at Central Saint Martins College in London. On leaving college she sets up her own fashion business TUTTABANKEM with her college friend Anne Buck. They held shows at the London designer collections and the pret-a-porter in Paris. In 1975 she held her first fashion show at the garage Covent Garden. Then she works as a freelance designer in Paris, Milan, New York and Hong Kong. Hamnett founded the Katharine E. Hamnett clothier in 1979. In 1981 she introduced menswear and the sales boomed worldwiede. Joseph opened the Chinese Laundry selling KATHARINE HAMNETT washed cottons in 1983. In the early 1980s Hamnett's oversized t-shirts with large block letter slogans were adopted by pop bands including Wham!, with her \"CHOOSE LIFE\" slogan prominently displayed in the music video for \"Wake Me Up Before You Go Go\" and somewhat less prominently in Queen's video for Hammer To Fall (worn by Roger Taylor). In 1984, ZTT's Paul Morley designed a series of \"FRANKIE SAY...\" T-shirts to promote the record label's chart act Frankie Goes to Hollywood (FGTH). Morley has stated that these designs were consciously based on Hamnett's slogan T-shirts: \"What persuaded me was reading Katharine Hamnett saying she wanted the T-shirts ripped off, which reminded me of Mark P, saying he wanted Sniffin' Glue to be ripped off. And I mean, I did a fanzine, so when I read that I thought, great, fanzine T-shirts!\" The official FGTH designs were particularly successful, and spawned many imitations of their own. At one point, Hamnett met with then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wearing her own t-shirt with the slogan \"58% DON'T WANT PERSHING\", a reference to polls showing public opposition in the United Kingdom against the basing of Pershing missiles in the country. In 2003, at a London fashion show, Hamnett's catwalk models wore shirts with \"NO WAR, BLAIR OUT\", a reference to the looming invasion of Iraq. More recently, models such as Naomi Campbell have appeared in Hamnett shirts bearing the slogans \"USE A CONDOM\" and \"PEACE\". Hamnett has since expressed scepticism that t-shirt slogans accomplish anything concrete. While she now suspects that for some, the slogans are a substitute for action, a sceptic might wonder if, having served her for so many years, they are a marketing device. The \"CHOOSE LIFE\" slogan, which in the context of the day was directed at drug abuse and suicide, has since been adopted by the pro-life movement, even appearing on license plates in Florida. Hamnett first ever British Fashion Awards, and in 1996, was voted Britain's favourite designer by readers of Cosmopolitan. The company's London shops have been designed by Norman Foster and Nigel Coates. Beginning in 1989, with research showing pesticide poisoning in cotton-growing regions, and sweatshop labour a major part of the textiles industry, Hamnett began lobbying for major changes in the way the industry operated. After disappointment with the results, Hamnett terminated most of her licensing arrangements, and in 2005 relaunched her line under stricter ethical guidelines, including manufacturing and agricultural practices. In 2008, Hamnett said that fashion designers participating in the London Fashion Week were racist due to what she views as increasing exclusion of black models, stating \"The catwalks are full of white dogs, cosmetic companies don't like black models - the racist bitches. I have no idea why when it's obvious that black girls are just so genuinely much more beautiful than Caucasians, who have clearly got the short straw. Black girls have much better body shapes and it's such a shame.

{"designer_name":"Kevan Hall","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/kevan-hall\/"],"biography":"Detroit-born Kevan Hall's fashion creativity emerged early. By the age of seven, he knew he wanted to be a fashion designer. After attending Cass Technical High School in Detroit, where he studied fashion design, he won first place as \"Designer of Tomorrow\" - a scholarship sponsored by the Los Angeles-based Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. While studying in California, he made a vision-enhancing trip to Europe, where at the houses of Cardin, Dior and most notably, Givenchy his lifelong love of luxury and haute couture was once again sparked. Upon graduation from the Fashion Institute, he received the Peacock Award for \u201cOutstanding Fashion Design\". \n In 1982, Hall with his wife and partner, Deborah launched Kevan Hall Couture. His collection melded a more relaxed couture look with sensible pricing that pleased retailers like Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, I. Magnin and other fine stores nationwide. \n Hall was nominated in 1988 by fashion retailers and the press as one of California\u2019s Top Designers. In 1989, he was not only included in the \u201cSoul on Seventh Avenue\u201d show sponsored by Fairchild Publications, but was also chosen by the NAACP to receive their \u201cGreat American Designer\u201d award. In 1990, his participation in the national Absolut Vodka campaign featured in Vanity Fair underscored his broad-based appeal. In 1992, he was honored by the Center of Performing Arts in Southern California with a 10-year fashion retrospective. For many, this would be a career capper. For Hall, it was only a stepping stone as he branched out into motion pictures, acting as costume consultant on 1997\u2019s \u201cGridlock\u201d and \u201cEve\u2019s Bayou\u201d (the most successful independent film of the year). \n   Redefining glamour for a new generation is an interpretive art. Redefining the hallowed house of Halston into the next millennium was an even more challenging task. But Kevan Hall--who stepped into the prestigious position of Design and Creative Director from fall 1998 - spring 2000 revived the dormant brand to its former glory. In 2002, he launched his own signature, Kevan Hall Collection with a fashion philosophy that emphasizes purity of style, incomparable tailoring and sensuously draped streamlined silhouettes; Hall has a natural design sense of sophisticated elegance and uncluttered modern design. Hall\u2019s designs have been embraced by fashion retailers and the press. In 2001, Absolut Vodka honored Hall by showcasing his spring collection in their \u201cTribute to African Designers\u201d worldwide tour. His lovely atelier in Los Angeles was featured in the July 2002 issue of Interior Design magazine. It confirmed his keen eye for design and impeccable color sense.

The business had quickly progrssaed from a showcase in someone else\u2019s hsop to her own boutique on Wlizabeth Street, moving after a few years to the even chicer surrounding of Walton Street. But the really smart move, as she now admits, was in not opening a string of stores at that time.","the_look":"Kiki's enduring success in the fine jewellery business is a testament to her creativity, eye for design and attention to detail.

He is a St. Martins trained British designer of furniture. Liza's father was an engineer who worked on Cadillacs and Lincolns and she is as fascinated by good car design as she is with good body design. \n She started her own company in New York in 1981, after attracting attention with the sophisticated swimwear she designed for herself and her friends. Apart from innovative designs, she has also used unusual fabrics like a thick lustre crepe, and a crinkle crepe mixed with Lycra. She also uses mohair and silk\/Lycra mixes. \n   In 1988, she expanded her range to include daywear like jackets and tunics. She makes easy-to-wear, easy-to-pack clothes which cling to the body. Do not expect to find accessories dotted around her shop, no, the Liza Bruce customer not only has a streamlined figure, but minimalist tastes. During the mid-1990s, Bruce expanded her product line in the U.S. while maintaining her large showroom and studio in London. She opened a large showroom in New York offering more affordable swimwear and activewear, and introduced a fragrance. Bruce wanted to have a home base in the U.S. to better serve her American clients, who include Barneys, Marks & Spencer, Charivari, and Saks Fifth Avenue. Yet in 1996 Bruce went into a voluntary liquidation of her wholesale business due to several financial factors, including a long copyright dispute with Marks & Spencer and the bankruptcy of her biggest account, Barneys New York. After a few years of regrouping, Bruce opened a small retail shop in London, selling to only a few selective American clients such as Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Harvey Nichols. Her new business once again features her popular swimwear, lingerie, and sportswear, and she planned to add jewelry and footwear. Bruce's new approach of opening smaller, more intimate stores appeals to her desire to veer away from commercialism. Her new sportswear collections feature the same wearable and functional fabrics as she has used for her swimwear\u2014modern fabrics that travel well. She has added Velcro closures to her clingy and stretchy pieces, and on some of her pieces she has haphazardly sewn in a label that reads, \"Luscious Bitch.\"","the_look":"In the eighties she was instrumental in the development of new Lycra based fabrics which she used to evolve her signature streamlined silhouette. For several seasons she worked exclusively with tubular fabrics and her preoccupation with streamlining led to her invention of leggings\u2019 and the evolution from her swimwear collection of \u2018the body\u2019 as the basis of the emancipated wardrobe of the eighties; she was undoubtedly the undisputed queen of the Black cat-suit, and the swimsuits she designed for the Robert Mapplethorpe \/ Lisa Lyon shoot for British Vogue in 1984 express her determination that women should be seen as strong, athletic, emancipated and sensual; accordingly she developed a cut that accentuated the length of the leg, lifted the bust and emphasized the waist!","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/liza.bruce","brands":["Liza Bruce"]}
{"designer_name":"Levi Strauss","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/levi-strauss\/"],"biography":"  Levi Strauss was born on February 26, 1829 in Bavaria, Germany as a Jewish German Bavarian. Levi Strauss was born as Loeb Strauss. \n In 1847, Strauss, his mother and two sisters moved to New York, to join his brothers, Jonas and Louis Loeb, in their dry goods business. \n   By 1850 he adopted the name \u201cLevi Strauss\u201d and in 1853, Strauss moved to San Francisco, California, during the gold mining boom. There he opened a dry goods wholesale business, Levi Strauss & Co., selling to small stores in California. Strauss observed that work clothes worn by gold prospectors and miners were not able to endure their torturous ordeal of working inside mine shafts, digging in the dirt and grime. Strauss developed the concept of and sold durable canvas pants. Initially, they were not very comfortable to wear but were very durable. Later, Strauss discovered denim. Strauss did not have any trouser material, but he did have some tent canvas which had come from De Nimes in France. He dyed this cloth in a dark blue colour and cut work trousers for the miners, and called the cloth \"denim\" from the French name \"De Nimes\". Initially, he made the trousers in two colours, indigo blue and brown cotton \"duck\". The brown was later dropped because the fabric did not get softer with use as the dark blue kind did. These trousers were so strong and useful that he made hundreds of them, known as \"jeans\". Jacob Davis, a tailor from Nevada, joined Levi Strauss in 1873 and he started to put copper rivets on the stress points of the working trousers, so that they did not tear at those points. These made the jeans much more long-lasting. On May 20, 1873 Strauss and Jacob Davis received a United States patent for using copper rivets to strengthen the pockets of denim work pants. Levi Strauss & Co. began manufacturing the first blue jeans in San Francisco. Levi Strauss died in 1902 but his family business continued and now the word Levi is synonymous with denim jeans. A few years ago, a pair of original Levi jeans was found in an old mine in California, buried under a lot of rubble. They were cleaned and sold at auction for several million dollars. From the 1960's Jeans have become a universal garment worn by men and women the world over. They were first featured in Vogue magazine in 1935.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Levis","Dockers","Levi Strauss Co"]}

More thatn a century later, Vuitton\u2019s handbags and luggage are now a stuatus symbol around the world and are often looked to in the world of fashion. \n The Louis Vuitton \u201cLV\u201d Monogram design can be considered the very first \u201cdesigner label\u201d on a product, as it was created in 1896 with the intent of prevention counterfeiting. \n   He was born in 1821 in Cons-le-Sannier. He was the son of a carpenter.  He moved from his hometown of Anchay, Jura France in 1835 at the age of fourteen. Two years later, he arrived in Paris and started working as an apprentice for trunk-maker and packing-case-maker Monsieur Marechal. Louis recognized a need for flat trunks which could go in the cargo hold of ocean-going ships or on luggage racks of trains, without getting damaged. So he took his first two names, and formed a company in 1854 to make high quality luggage. Right from the beginning, Louis insisted on extraordinary quality and craftsmanship, catering to the rich people who appreciated the beauty of his products. He found himself luggage maker to kings, stars and noble people almost immediately.

While still a teenager, Dache was apprenticed to a Bordeaux milliner. Several years later she moved to Paris and worked for Caroline Rebux and Suzanne Talbot. \n When she was 16 Lilly was sent off to live with an uncle in Atlantic City, USA. She became a millinery saleswoman in Macy's Department store in New York for a few months, and then started working for the Bonnet Shop. When she saved up enough money, she bought out the owner and established it as her own salon. After that, she was very successful financially. \n   At the end of the 20's when hats were still \"de rigueur\", she erected the Lilly Dache Building on East 56th Street, New York. Working with Travis Banton in Hollywood, she also designed hats for movies, such as the Towering fruit-bedecked Carmen Miranda turbans. In 1931, Lilly married Jean Despres and they had a daughter named Suzanne. Suzanne grew up to have her own design studio with help and encouragement from her mother. Their mutual love and successful supportive professional lives and collaboration endeared them to those around them. Her major contributions to milinery were draped turbans, brimmed hats molded to the head, half hats, visored caps for war workers, colored snoods, and romantic massed-flower shapes. By 1949, she was designing dresses to go with her hats, as well as lingerie, loungewear, gloves, hosiery, and a wired strapless bra. Both the designer Halston and the hair stylist Kenneth worked for her before going into business for themselves. Lilly Dache was considered the top milliner in New York, when hats were considered more important than dresses. She attracted a vast movie star clientele which included Betty Grable and Marlene Dietrich. One of her achievements was the discovery and encouragement of the fashion designer Halston, who went on to be so successful in the 60's and 70's. Shortly after World War II, she added dresses, accessories and perfumes to her millinery line. Known for her sometimes outrageously flamboyant style, Dache was famous for draped turbans, close-fitting brimmed Cloche hats, Snoods and Caps. For almost three decades, she was the foremost milliner in the USA. Lilly was awarded the Coty Fashion Award in 1943. In 1946, Lilly Dache wrote a best-selling book called \"Talking Through my Hats\". She wrote another in 1956, called \"The Glamour Book\". Lilly Dache continued to create ready-to-wear millinery collections throughout the 1950's and 1960's. Lilly retired in 1968, and her New York millinery business was taken over by her daughter Suzanne Dach\u00e9. Her husband had been with Coty for 50 years, rising from stock boy to vice-president. He was a founder of the Fragrance Foundation and the Toilet Goods Association. He was one of the first members of the New YorkAthletic Club when it opened and a lifelong member of the Metropolitan Club. Jean Despres' father was a mathematics professor at the Sorbonne. In 1968 he was retiring. So Lilly decided to retire too. They spent 20 years between their New York and Paris homes and she stopped wearing hats. Lilly remained active in fashion, interior design and art until her death, designing men's casual Golf apparel, as well as the interior of her homes in France and Florida. She created sculptures and macrame and encouraged American fashion designers like Geoffrey Beene in France. A busy retirement. She died in 1989 at the age of 93 in Louveciennes, France. In the year 2000\/2002, the city of New York decided to honour 24 American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along the pavement of 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York.

{"designer_name":"Lilly Pulitzer","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/lilly-pulitzer\/"],"biography":"Lilly Pulitzer was born around 1935 (her name was actually Roslyn) in New York, United States. Lilly Pulitzer is a socialite and prominent fashion designer. \n Lilly Pulitzer was christened Lillian Lee McKim to a socialite family in Roslyn, New York in 1931; Lilly Lee was her nickname among her friends. She was a middle child with an older sister, Mary Maude (called Memsey) and a younger sister Florence Fitch (Flossie). \n She attended the Chapin School in New York City, along with the Bouvier sisters, Jacqueline and Lee. In 1949, she graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut. She attended the college-cum-finishing school Fitch in New York City, but left after one semester to work as a midwife's assistant in West Virginia and as a volunteer at the Veterans Hospital in The Bronx. \n   She married Peter Pulitzer, grandson of the Pulitzer Prize's Joseph Pulitzer and settled in Palm Beach, Florida. In 1960, she was a bored housewife, and to keep herself busy, she started selling fruit juice. In the course of working at the juice stand, Lilly found that squeezing juice made a mess of her clothes. Seeking to camouflage the juice stains, Lilly asked her dressmaker to design a sleeveless shift dress made of bright, colorful printed cotton. Lilly loved the dress that was produced for her, and it would later become her \"Classic Shift Dress.\" Lilly quickly found that customers loved her dress, so she had her dressmaker produce more in order to sell at her juice stand. Soon, however, she was selling more dresses than juice, so she decided to stop selling juice and instead focus on designing and selling what had become known as her \"Lillys.\" Lilly's shift dresses suddenly became a fashion sensation. She founded a company in Palm Beach, Florida, USA. She could not sew, but was able to translate her ideas to seamstresses, who made up her designs into dresses. Lilly put her signature on every dress and initially sold them from a stall, then as she got more prosperous, she opened a boutique. She popularized a one-piece brightly printed cotton dress, which became known as a \"Lilly. Her company also sold A-line skirts and dresses in unusual colour combinations, such as pink and green which were her trademarks along with bold floral prints with butterflies and chrysanthemums. Lilly Pulitzer's clothes were popular with society women and she opened boutiques throughout the USA. Her dresses were successful for about 25 years. She closed her company in 1984. In 1969, Lilly and Peter were divorced. She married Enrique Rousseau shortly thereafter. Although she legally changed her name to \"Lillian McKim Rousseau,\" her clothing company continued to operate under the \"Lilly Pulitzer\" label with amazing success. Lilly continued to enjoy Palm Beach life, watching her children and grandchildren grow up. Enrique died from cancer in 1993 just as the fashion label was revived. Thus, it came as a surprise to the fashion world when in January 1993 Lilly Pulitzer allowed her line to be revived. Lilly is not involved in the day to day administration of the company, but she continues to serve in the role of creative consultant, approving new designs, fabrics, and collections. Good sales have inspired branching out into other product lines. The company also produces Lilly bedding, men's clothing, children's clothing, maternity clothes, shoes, jewelry, and accessories. Today, the company maintains 70 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores, several company-owned retail stores, and sells in major department stores such as Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, and Neiman Marcus. Lilly Pulitzer clothing has once again become popular now. Lilly Pulitzer, now in her 60's, is still keeping an eye on the company. She recently made a store appearance to introduce the new Fall collection and signed autographs on Lilly skirts. Vintage Lilly may be hard to come by, but the new dresses in prints and colours we all love are available from the Florida stores. In August 2003, Llily was called upon by the Ford Company Campaign against Breast Cancer. She designed this lovely scarf as a fitting symbol and it is being sold by the thousands as aid for this very worthy cause. In 2006\/7, the Lilly Pulitzer identity was rebranded to bring Lilly's aesthetic to a whole new generation and audience to include a men's line and home collection.","the_look":"Jackie Kennedy","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lillypulitzer","brands":["Lilly Pulitzer"]}

This wedding dress was of ivory satin, scattered with delicate embroidery and beadwork using the bee motif, which was based on the Ferguson coat of arms. In 1987 she started up her first ready-to-wear collection. She specializes in fine embroidery and beading, which she incorporates in her feminine but formal clothes for day and evening. Today, Lindka works from a studio in South Kensington, an oasis of peace and calm from which dreams are materialised. Her designs range from chic day wear, provocative cocktail, red carpet evening wear to the ultimate in wedding dresses.","the_look":"Inspired by her love of luxurious and unique fabrics and using her own inspirational beadwork and embroidery, Lindka designs ultra-feminine, flattering and exquisite Couture.","who_wears_it":["HRH The Princess Royal","The Duchess of York","The Duchess of Kent","Princess Czartoryski-Bourbon","The Duchess of Roxborough","Lady Victoria Hervey","Lady Lloyd Webber","Lady Kathy Botham","Ruthie Henshall","Penny Lancaster","Catherine Zeta Jones","Jemma Kidd","Sophie Anderton","Lady Helen Stewart","Jilly Cooper","Sarah Brightman","Nicola Benedetti","Katherine Jenkins and Lesley Garrett."],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lindkacierachcouture","brands":["Lindka Cierach"]}
{"designer_name":"Liz Claiborne","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/liz-claiborne\/"],"biography":"Elizabeth (Liz) Claiborne was from a New Orleans family, but since her father worked as a banker in Belgium, she was born in 1929 in Brussels. She studied at the Fine Arts School and Painter's Studio, in Belgium. She also studied at the Nice Academy in France. Her father's work meant that they were always on the move, but by the time she was a teenager, her family had finally settled in the United States. \n She always wanted to be a fashion designer, but her father was not keen on the idea and sent her to Paris to study art. \n In 1949, she won a HARPERS BAZAAR Jacques Heim design contest, which entitled her to travel and sketch in Europe. On her return to New York, she joined Tina Leser where she worked for two years. Later she worked at Omar Kiam where she was design assistant to Ben Reig. \n   Liz married Ben Schultz in 1950 but that marriage ended in divorce. She had a son named Alexander. She married Arthur Ortenberg in 1957. In 1954 Liz started up as a New York free-lance designer. In 1960 she began to design for the Youth Guild Inc, a division of Jonathan Logan. She worked here for 16 years. During the 1960;s she was one of the many designers who helped promote the idea of removing the strict classifications of clothes for specific occasions, by designing a complete wardrobe of mix-and-match separates. In 1976, Claiborne started up her own company, along with her second husband Arthur Ortenberg, and their friends Leonard Boxer and Jerome Chaze. This went public in 1981. For nearly 30 years the Liz Claiborne company has produced predominantly youthful, fashion-conscious clothes. The company's forte has been casual, separates-based working wardrobes, sold in a medium-price range. In 1980 her innovative designs were so successful that she became the first woman in the US fashion industry to be named \"Entrepreneur of the Year\". Merrill Lynch described her company as a \"case history of success\". Liz was awarded the CFDA designer of the year award in 1985. In 1989, when she reached 60, Liz and her husband Arthur personally retired from active work in the company although she still keeps an eye on the house that bears her name. In retirement, Claiborne and Ortenberg founded a foundation that distributed millions in funding to environmental causes including funding the television series Nature on PBS television and nature conservancy projects around the world. She had been advised in 1997 that she had a rare form of cancer affecting the lining of the abdomen. Liz Claiborne died on June 26, 2007 at the age of 78, following a long battle with the cancer. Liz Claiborne Inc., is a billion dollar concern going into the 21st century. It now employs around 8,000 people. The Net sales in 2000 were over $ 3 billion. The Liz Claiborne Corporation controls an estimated one-third of the $ 10 billion US market for womens sportswear, and sells through 3500 retailers in the US. It has acquired several other designer houses, mostly those started by women, such as Sigrid Olsen and Dana Buchman.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1986  Liz Claiborne (W)","1990  Realities (W)","1993  Vivid (W)","1996  Curve (W)","1997  Liz Sport (W)","2000  Lucky You (W)","2000  Lucky You (M)","2001  Mambo(W)","2003  Spark (W)","2004  Curve Crush (W)","2004  Spark Seduction (W)","Bora Bora - launch date unknown","1989  Liz Claiborne for men","1989  Curve for men","1997  Claiborne Sport (M)","2000  Lucky You (M)","2001  Mambo (M)","2003  Spark (M)","2004  Curve Crush (M)","2005  Spark Seduction (M)","2005  Curve Wave (M)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Dkny Jeans","Isaac Mizrahi","Liz Claiborne","Liz Claiborne New York"]}
{"designer_name":"Lloyd Klein","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/lloyd-klein\/"],"biography":"Lloyd Klein was born in Canada in 1967 of French parents. His father was vice-President of an International airline. During his childhood Lloyd lived in 6 countries, primarily France and as a result speaks 5 languages fluently. His college years were spent as a serious student of architecture, with studies in Europe and an internship in the United States. He recognized that fashion was the field he wanted, after attending his first Paris fashion show (of Hubert de Givenchy) when he was 19. This made a deep impression on him. \n He has not had any formal fashion school training, but developed a keen interest in the work of Yves St. Laurent, Jacques Fath, Givenchy and American classic Halston. In 1986 he staged his first show in Paris in a hotel ballroom. It was successful enough for him to be encouraged to continue on the fashion path. He could see that his ideas for sophisticated simplicity, fondness for glamour, original thought and dedication to new ideas were the way to go. \n In Spring\/Summer 1994, Klein presented a collection on the elegant stage of the Opera Comique in Paris. The following season, he stunned the French fashion community by accepting the appointment as head designer for the house of Madame Gres. \n   He remained there for 5 seasons, but simultaneously continued his own identity as a designer, creating separate seasonal collections which have been shown in London, Milan, as well as Russian and Asian cities. In 1998, Klein set up his new company headquarters in the United States and in September 1999 presented his Spring\/Summer 2000 collection at Bryant Park in New York. His Fall 2001 collection was inspired by the Marlon Brando movie \"Last Tango in Paris\". One of the garments was an asymmetrical black leather dress. Actress Maria Schneider, who starred in the film, wore his clothes at the show. Practically everything that Lloyd Klein sent down the catwalk was black. Klein's Spring 2002 collection was shown in Los Angeles. It was comprised of all white, simple yet sexy silhouettes. Lloyd came back to New York to present his Spring\/Summer 2003 collection. He chose as venue, the famous Studio 54 nightclub from the 70's. Using a tailoring technique he calls \"coupe franc\" (raw cut) he made dark gray jackets bursting with shocking pink frayed edges and navy blue separates marked by blood orange accents to give a bleeding effect. He attributes this inspiration to the raw, frayed and bloody times of September 11th 2001 terrorist attack. His ateliers are in Paris, his business headquarters in Los Angeles, USA, and his press and sales showrooms are in New York and Beverley Hills. The media are dubbing Lloyd \"the New Klein in Town\" after the retirement of Calvin Klein. This is not really fair as he is hardly new. We have been seeing his exquisite clothes for a decade or more. His 2004 collection was inspired by strong and confident elegant women of the 1930's. He used masculine fabrics and turned them into feminine couture. Liquid satins, powdered crepes, crisp cottons, lush organza, bouncy tulle, irridescent silks and chiffons became garments that emphasized relaxed luxury. It was a very beautiful show and it seems that Lloyd is really the only \"Klein in Town\". Everything was all set to show the Fall collection during New York Fashion Week in February 2004. However on the way to the airport in Paris, Lloyd Klein and his staff had a serious car accident, which forced the cancellation of the New York show. Lloyd's mother and his staff were relatively slightly injured, but Lloyd himself was in a coma for several days. He came round and has now recovered completely.","the_look":"Klein's combination of intricate fabric draping, his signature sleeve cut, strong shoulder construction and choice of fabric are wonderful.

In 1975 he created his first fragrance for women, 'Couture', which became his signature scent. Over time Azzaro became known for his fragrances as much as his clothing. Azzaro's gowns are imaginative and sexy, and are still very much appreciated even though some of them are more than 30 years old now, and are available on a vintage basis.

She studied fashion at Central St. Martins College, in London. She resides in the company of her fashion-photographer boyfriend, David Sims, and their two children, Kip and Stevie. \n She is a British Vogue fashion journalist turned fashion designer. She uses the name \"Luella\" for her fashion house. \n Her first collection in 2000, only consisted of 6 models showing off her clothes in a friend's apartment, but three seasons on, she held a full-scale fashion show with celebrity fans Kate Moss and Texas singer Sharleen Spiton seated in the front row. \n   Elle gave her the \"Young Designer Award\" for 2000. 'Dial F for Fluoro', a show which helped launched 2001's trend for graffiti chic. This collection completely commenced brand awareness to an international level. At this point, Bartley hailed as London\u2019s hot, young, and fresh designer. Bartley decided to take a risk and began, what is now called 'The Luella Roadshow.' She bascially takes her team and shows at venues in Milan and New York. The titles, as Luella later explained, of her shows are a hangover from her earlier days in journalism. Bartley was also asked, by Bottega Veneta to present her collection \u2018Looking Hard in the Yard' in Milan for the autumn\/winter2000 season. Luella's Spring 2002 collection was shown in New York. She put on clothes full of quirks and made with a sense of humour and fun. There was an almost complete absence of colour this time around, with everything black except for some Navajo tops. Then suddenly everything changed and colourful bikinis in geometric prints made their appearance. Luella's candy-striped blazers were a hit and faded denim jeans which were distressed to kill. Luella is now poised to be a favourite with the younger fashion crowd. In Fall 2002, Luella has entered into financial partnership with New Look, who plan to show her clothes in 20 of their largest stores. Her profile was further enhanced by her partnership with British leathergoods company Mulberry, for whom she designed a line of bags. Following the success of the collaboration, Bartley signed a deal with majority Mulberry shareholder Club 21 to produce a small line of accessories that eventually grew to include clothing and a complete accessory collection. Luella has also collaborated with Vans, Churches, Sony and M.A.C. On a personal note, Luella and her partner fashion photographer David Simms, had their first child, a boy named Kip in Summer 2003.

This was sited in Milan's fashion rectangle, in the road which gave its name to the boutique: Via Pietro Verri. After just a few years, due to the desire to meet the needs of an increasingly demanding clientele, Verri was transformed into Verri Uomo, a true brand name, renowned for its ability to unite elegance, quality and creativity in a single collection. \n In 1978, after the launching of the first publicity campaign, Verri began to enter the overseas markets with great success, expanding its projects beyond national boundaries. In the following year Verri was present for the first time on the catwalks of the Milanese fashion parades with a simple but very high quality collection. The philosophy of the product was characterised by elegance without constraints and clothes of extremely high quality which could, however, be worn at any time and in any place. \n Many prestigious boutiques were opened throughout the world due to international diffusion of the brand name in the years following its creation, including New York's first pret-a-porter boutique on Madison Avenue in 1979 and Tokyo's first boutique in 1984. \n   At the end of the 1980s the Verri style was chosen by Paramount Pictures to create the look and the clothes for Al Pacino, Andy Garcia and Chazz Palminteri in the last episode of The Godfather trilogy by Francis Ford Coppola presented in cinemas in 1990. It was also selected for Don Johnson in the Miami Vice television series. The middle eastern market began to develop in the 1990s with the opening of the Dubai and Abu-Dhabi boutiques, followed by Kiev in 1999. Then the Chinese market began to expand from the year 2000 with the opening of single-brand boutiques in the most important squares of the Chinese People's Republic. The expansion of the eastern market in the Empire of the Rising Sun became much more efficient with the assistance of a twenty-year partnership which sustained Verri during the opening of many shops throughout Japan. Verri is a brand suitable for the majority, embracing practically everyone whilst encapsulating its acquired experience and history in collections distinguished by quality tailoring, always up to date and with an eye to the future.

He is best known as a supplier of unique jewellery and rare jewels to the wealthy. He recut the diamond, removing 4 carats and receiving criticism for altering the historic jewel. \n Graff was born in Stepney (the London East End) in 1938 into a Jewish family, the son of a Romanian mother (Rebecca Segal) and Russian father (Harry Graff). His father made suits off the Commercial Road while his mother ran a tobacconist and newsagents. His brother Raymond was born in 1947. Around 1962, he married his wife Anne-Marie. The couple have two sons, Francois and Stephane. Francois works in the diamond business and Stephane is a photographer and painter. In 2009 they were in the process of divorcing but became reconciled and decided to stay married. At the time of their divorce proceedings, Laurence's mistress of nine years was pregnant with his child. \n He left school and became an apprentice when he was 14. He was fired from that job after three months. His next job trained him to repair rings and create small pieces of jewellery. That jewellery shop went out of business. Graff began selling his jewellery designs independently to jewellers all over England. By 1962, he had two jewellery shops, including the first in Hatton Garden. This district is now famous for its cluster of jewellery shops. In 1960, he founded the Graff Diamonds company. By 1974, he had begun specializing in selling to newly rich buyers from the Middle East. In particular, he supplied many jewels for Hassanal Bolkiah, the 29th Sultan of Brunei. He is the founder of Graff Diamonds. \n   In 2008, Graff purchased the Wittelsbach Diamond for 16.4 million pounds Sterling, which was a considerable premium over the 9 million pounds Sterling guide price. Almost two years later, Graff revealed he had had three diamond cutters repolish the stone to eliminate the chips and improve the clarity, reducing the diamond from 35.52 carats to 31. This action has been compared by critics to making the Mona Lisa prettier. The renamed Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond and the Hope Diamond will be on display together at the Smithsonian Institution beginning the end of January 2010. Graff is one of Britain's richest men. His personal fortune is, according to the 2009 Sunday Times Rich List, estimated to be L1.2bn ($1.9bn, \u20ac1.4bn). Laurence Graff has handled the most fabulous and treasured gemstones and diamonds in the world, including The Idol's Eye, The Emperor Maximillian, The Porter Rhodes, The Windsor Diamonds, The Hope of Africa, The Begum Blue, The Paragon, The Star of America, The Golden Star, The Wittelsbach-Graff and The Lesotho Promise, The Delaire Sunrise and The Graff Constellation to name but a few. Symbolising the brand and the values it stands for, Laurence Graff oversees the finding and production of the unique and exceptional diamonds he has always loved. Having set an unsurpassed standard of excellence and innovation in the industry, it has been said that he has handled more important quality gemstones than any other Diamantaire. In 2007 Graff published 'The Most Fabulous Jewels in the World' a definitive coffee table book chronicling Graff's amazing journey and important jewels. All proceeds of this publication support the Nelson Mandela's Children's Fund. In addition to supporting an array of charities through the Graff Diamonds Foundation, Graff also established FACET (For Africa's Children Every Time), devoted to distributing funds for the education, health and welfare of children throughout Africa. The Graff Leadership Centre in Lesotho directly benefits from funding from FACET and acts as a training centre, hostel and home to 50 orphan girls, victims of the AIDS and HIV epidemic.

This was then however followed by a Product \n   Design & Development Degree at London College of Fashion in 2003 which finally satisfied her love of art and design. During her Fashion Degree she pounced on the very first corsetry module she could, and produced a first class mark which fuelled her passion for structured curves. Lee Klabin started with bespoke corsets and very detailed couture pieces that inspired the likes of Dita von Teese, Lily Cole, Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Field which led her to launch her debut evening Ready-to-Wear collection. This collection encapsulates \u2018traditional tailoring meets technology\u2019. With a burning passion to \u2018evolve what works,\u2019 Lee is forever looking for new ways to fuse the beauty of traditional tailoring, with modern femininity. Using boning in a unique and creative way is just the start.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/leeklabin","brands":["Lee Klabin"]}

Their father had been a painter and teacher of design, and their mother a lace maker. \n Gradually the sisters formed a Couture house making all manner of wonderful garments. Although their married names were different, they called their salon Callot Soeurs (Sisters).

In the 1920's, Madame Marie Callot Gerber, the eldest sister, was referred to as the \"backbone of the fashion world of Europe\". In 1920, Callot was also the originator of the \"manteau d'abbe\" the short cape flying from the shoulders of coats and evening gowns. Madame Madeleine Vionnet was trained at Callot Soeurs, and credited them with training her in design techniques which enable her to achieve success with her own salon. She said \"without the example of the Callot sisters, I would have continued to make Fords. It is because of them that I have been able to make Rolls-Royces.\" (she was referring to the cheap car and the luxury car.)

{"designer_name":"Mariuccia Mandelli Krizia","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/mariuccia-mandelli-krizia\/"],"biography":"  Mariuccia Mandelli was born in 1933. She spent a lot of her childhood time in a friend's dressmaking shop. \n She had trained as a teacher, and had begun selling skirts and dresses in 1951. Krizia is the name, Mariuccia Mandelli chose, to make her dream come true. She borrowed the name from the title of Plato's unfinished dialogue on women's vanity and spelt it with a K to make it sound more exotic. Plato's Crizia is a man who squanders all his riches on jewellery and clothing for beautiful and compliant women. \n   It is the beginning of the 1950s and Krizia, the designer, embarks on her adventure. With a friend, Flora Dolci, she rents two rooms in Milan which become her first design studio and workshop. The Krizia label is born on skirts. Dresses follow, in a fresh, young style, already featuring fitted sleeves framed by a flat smooth line. But it was tough at the beginning: making people appreciate her designs and obtaining loans from banks. In time, success is inevitable. Freedom of choice is her let motif. In 1954, helped by her husband Aldo Pinto, she formed a company Kriziamaglia, in Milan, Italy. Her fashion is adaptable to any lifestyle, situation or cultural revolution and still maintains a feminine touch. Over the years, Krizia's constant research for new materials goes hand in hand with introducing new outlines. The first models she showed in public in 1957 included a series of fruit print dresses. Next come a striking black and white collection showed at the Pitti Palace in Florence in 1964. Pleating, careful attention to shoulders and the use of fanciful animals on her clothes are only some of the distinctive features that have recurrently turned Krizia's creations into successes. She branched out into knitwear designs in 1967 and later into complete ranges of ready-to-wear clothes. Walter Albini worked at Krizia from 1960 to 1963 and Aldo Ferrante was also a designer there in the late 60's. Mariuccia Mandelli always has the strong support of her husband Aldo Pinto, who looks after organization and commercial coordination. Mariucci Mandelli was honoured with the title Commendore of the Italian Republic in 1986. Today over 50 collections a year are created for the various Krizia labels, which includes menswear, children's wear, knitwear, as well as glasses, handbags, ties, perfumery, kitchen furniture and much more. With the strong support of her husband Aldo Pinto, who is in charge of the company's organizational and commercial coordination, Mariuccia Mandelli manages a growing enterprise with increasing sales worldwide. Greg Myler was the designer for Krizia from 1987 to 2000, when he left to join Mila Schon. Gianbattista Valli was the designer for the house of Krizia from 1995 to 1997, when he left to join Ungaro. In 2000, the Israeli designer Alber Elbaz, took over as chief designer at Krizia, after leaving YSL Rive Gauche ready-to-wear. However after only one brilliant collection, he left as they could not agree on terms. Elbaz went on to Lanvin. He was followed by Belgian designer Jean-Paul Knott, who joined Krizia in November 2001. However in February 2002, he parted from Krizia for reasons unknown. He had only designed two collections for Krizia. Mariuccia Mandelli, who is still very much a hands-on designer at her house, brought in English designer Hamish Morrow to add fresh ideas to the design. In February 2004 Hamish Morrow left Krizia as he said he found it impossible to fulfil his vision for the label. Mariuccia Mandelli would now oversee the label's artistic direction with the help of a team of young designers. Mariuccia Mandelli has a part-time activity, designing hotels. She designed the K Clube which looks like a film set, and has in fact been used for shoots on many occasions. It is on the Caribbean island of Bermuda.

In 1987 Marc Jacobs received the \"Perry Ellis Award for New Fashion Talent\", the highest tribute possible in the American fashion world. In 1989 Marc Jacobs joined Perry Ellis and was named Vice-President of Women's Design. While at Perry Ellis, Marc Jacobs created the designer collection as well as overseeing the various women's licensees. In 1992, the CFDA once agai bestowed Jacobs with a distint honor: womenswear designer of the year. He left Perry Ellis in 1993, he went back to designing under his own label. He favours sensuous fabrics such as angora, cashmere and mohair and will occasionally surprise with neon rubber separates and laminated sequined jeans. In 1997, he was voted Womenswear Designer of the Year by the CFDA. At the same year, he won the design job at Louis Vuitton, the elegant French luggage maker. He has introduced modern pop and kisch into their sedate image. He also makes what the New York Times calls his 'caviar clothes' for the up market women. Rich women in the 30's are attracted to his witty update of the Vuitton brand that has been carried by generations before them. Robert Duffy is Jacobs business partner, who has worked with him from his earliest days at Perry Ellis. Louis Vuitton is owned by LVMH of Arnault Bernard, the same owner of Givenchy and Dior. LVMH appointed Jacobs to the helm of Vuitton giving him responsibility for launching the ready-to-wear collections, and adding new accessories to the existing lines. Marc Jacobs has now moved to Paris, although he prefers working in his New York studio. His Paris studio is just steps away from the Louvre and Notre Dame Cathedral. Marc Jacobs is just the person to propel the 154 year old company into the future. Vuitton, an impeccable but rather conservative leather-goods house, is now one of the world's most sought-after fashion labels. In the year 2000\/2002, the city of New York decided to honour 24 American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along the pavement of 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Marc Jacobs was one of those honoured with a plaque. In May, Marc Jacobs confirmed that he had signed a new contract with LVMH for ten years. He issued an emotional statement that Bernard Arnault had helped him considerably and his loyalty was never in question. We will therefore be seeing his designs at Louis Vuitton for many years to come. In August 2004, Marc celebrated the opening of his latest US store in Boston. The theme was the Olympics which were going on at the time, and Marc himself was decked out in fencing kit. This year he will open stores in Los Angeles, Shanghai and Chicago. the label Marc Jacobs is very well known for his accesory line with handbags, sun glasses, perfume, wallets, watches and jewelry. Next to the accesory line there's also Marc Jacobs jeans, suits, shirts, coats and even flipflops.","the_look":"Bright colors, oversize prints, layered looks, empire lines, rugby stripes, oversize bows and buttons, and pretty, prom-like party dresses.","who_wears_it":["The downtown crowd with eclectic or edgy tastes","including Winona Ryder","Uma Thurman","the Olsen twins","Drew Barrymore","Sophia Coppola","Scarlett Johansson","and Maggie Gyllenhall."],"perfumes":["2001 Marc Jacobs (W)","2002 Marc Jacobs (M)","2003 Marc Jacobs Essence (W)","2004 Marc Jacobs Blush (W)","2007 Marc Jacobs Splash (W)","2007 Splash in Orange (W)","2007 Splash in Rain (W)","2007 Splash in Cucumber (W)","2007 Daisy (W)"],"social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/marcjacobs","brands":["Little Marc Jacobs","Marc By Marc Jacobs","Louis Vuitton","Marc Jacobs","Marc Jacobs Eyewear"]}

After moving to Milan and well into her thirties, she decides to enter the world of high fashion. All she knew about it until then was that she enjoyed wearing the dresses which she was used to buying in Paris. She was initially a customer of Balenciaga and she gained her love of couture, by wearing his clothes. \n This charming and elegant lady of aristocratic origins had no cutting or sewing experience but with a small group of able workers she set up a workshop in Milan in 1958. The first soberly cut coats and dresses were produced and their refined touch was not missed by the elegant Milanese women. In January 1965, at the invitation of Giovan Battista Giorgini, Mila Sch\u00f6n presents her first collection at Florence's Palazzo Pitti. It was well received in Italy and the USA. A year later she opens her Milan boutique on Via Montenapoleone in an antique palazzo, once the residence of the Italian poet Carlo Porta. The future holds international recognition in store for her and the Florence show is only the first in a series of successes. \n   The enthusiasm of a buyer from the fabled department store Neiman Marcus takes her to the United States where she presented her collections in Houston and Dallas and is awarded the Fashion Oscar for Colour in 1967. At the end of the decade, Mila Sch\u00f6n is offering dresses which were compared to works of art such as those by Josef Albers, Calder and Fontana. In 1971 Mila Sch\u00f6n launches her men's line and the same year sees the birth of the women ready-to-wear collections. This latter line has a wider public in mind but no less demanding. And before the end of the decade the men's ready-to wear collections will also be launched. In January 1990 Mila Sch\u00f6n is celebrating her 50th high fashion show with a collection whose prints are inspired to the world of William Morris. A couple of years later a new line of accessories is launched, including handbags, foulards and shoes. Mila Schon also designs uniforms for airlines and has made for Alitalia in 1969 and Iran Air in 1972. She made uniforms for the Milan Soccer team and the clothes worn by the Italian national team for the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. On Thurday, 4th Septemper Mila Schon died. The cause of her death was not reported.","the_look":"Essentially a classic designer of dresses, suits and eveningwear, Schon, though not as well known as many of her colleagues, is one of the most respected names in Italian fashion and is noted for her sophisticated style and precise tailoring. Schon's favourite fabric was double-faced wool and this white suit represents her design signature. She was a perfectionist who worked within a classical structure, to exacting specifications and she created modernist garments. Her evening gowns take on a growing importance in her successive collections. They include some embroidered in white and silver, those with Gobelin motifs, and those of Persian inspiration.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1981 Mila Schon (W)","1986 Mila Schon Uomo (W)","1990 Haute Couture (W)","1997 Schon (W)","1990's Y-10 Avenue (W)","2005 Mila Sch\u00f6n (W) relaunched"],"social_media":"","brands":["Mila Schn"]}
{"designer_name":"Miuccia Prada","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/miuccia-prada\/"],"biography":"  Miuccia Prada's grandfather, Mario, founded the family luxury leather goods company in Milan in 1913. \n 1950 Miuccia Prada was born. She was an unlikely successor, having spent the last five years studying to became a doctorate in political science and performing mime at Milan's Teatro Piccolo, being a paid-up member of the Communist party and champion of women's rights in Seventies' Milan. But she soon proved her worth. \n   In 1970 she started making backpack bags out of waterproof fabric called Pocone. 1979 She took over the Prada family business. Since sales were down, she expanded into luxury tote bags and backpacks in black with flat classic lines, made from nylon. In 1985, she designed a new line of black, unlabelled, hard-wearing, but finely-woven nylon handbags that immediately became must-haves for the fashion cognoscenti, seen hanging off the arm of the likes of Jerry Hall and Marie Helvin. With retail prices starting at around L250, a bootlegging industry quickly sprang up, making the authentic articles even more desirable. More importantly, Prada bags were established as the accessory of choice for supermodels and fashion editors the world over. Prada launched her eponymous ready-to-wear collection for autumn\/winter 1989 to critical acclaim. The plain, almost austere lines of her designs provided a stark contrast to the overtly sensual designs of other labels of the time and one admiring fashion journalist described Prada's clothes as \"uniforms for the slightly disenfranchised\". In 1992, she debuted the less expensive bridge line Miu Miu (Miuccia's nickname), inspired by her personal wardrobe of earthier, hippies garments in natural fabrics and colours. Clean and stylish designs, fine materials and exquisite craftsmanship conspired to win Prada a Council of Fashion Designers of America International Award in 1993. A year later, she showed in New York for the first time and opened her London boutique. She now shows for Prada and Miu Miu twice a year in Milan. 1998 Prada opened their first menswear shop in Los Angeles, USA. They also opened new Prada stores in Manhattan and Las Vegas, as well as Miu Miu's first North American boutique, in Los Angeles. Prada is now a worldwide empire, with stores in practically every country in the western world. It is a million dollar concern, with every celebrity wearing Prada clothes. the label Patrizio Bertelli (Miuccia Prada's husband) made a series of acquisitions which began in the late 90;s, taking over Helmut Lang, Church Shoes, Jil Sander, Fendi and other companies. Prada (as part of a consortium) took over the house of Jil Sander in 2000, but Bertelli had a fight with the designer who had built up the house of her own name and the result was that she left. As part of her agreement to leave, Jil Sander is not permitted to have anything to do with fashion till 2003. At the end of 2001, they were some $ 1 billion in debt. They decided to sell Fendi to LVMH (who own Dior, Givenchy and other houses) for S 250 million. Industry watchers felt that Prada was facing a serious cash crisis. Then in April 2002, Prada sold Byblos, a house that they had only acquired in June 2001. Fabio Zambernardi joined Prada in 1997 and his design responsibilities have grown with the company. In December 2002, he was appointed Design director for Prada and Miu Miu, thus becoming Miuccia Prada's main man.","the_look":"Fabrics - Miuccia Prada uses a lot of crunchy polyester, parachute nylon and other synthetic fabrics. Colours - she likes Battleship green, browns, white, cream, and black. Simple destructured shapes, knee length skirts, her skinny belts had become the currency of success in the mid 90's. Her clothes are not exactly fashionable. There is no defining accent, just a grouping of desirable useful things in exquisite fabrics. Her clothes, though often deceptively plain looking, have become widely influential. She gives traditional garments a modern handling, like trimming nylon parkas with mink and making trench coats and twin sets out of silk faille. It seems that the whole world craves Prada's ice-cool minimalism and deadpan eroticism.","who_wears_it":["Cameron Diaz","Salma Hayak and Maggie Gyllenhall"],"perfumes":["1990 Prada (W) (reissue 2004)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Prada","Miu Miu"]}
{"designer_name":"Maria Nielli","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/maria-nielli\/"],"biography":"  Maria Nielli was born in 1883 in Turin and her family moved to Florence when she was five years old. Subsequently, her family moved to France in 1895 when she was 12 years old. \n At the age of 13, she was apprenticed to a dressmaker and by 18 had become the head of the salon and by 22 it's chief designer. \n   In 1904 she married a jeweller named Luigi Ricci and they had a son named Robert in 1905. In 1908 Nina joined the house of Raffin as a designer and remained there for 20 years. In 1932, at the age of 50, Madame Ricci decided to open her own house, and she and her son set up the House of Ricci. There Madame Ricci created the garments and Robert ran the business. It grew rapidly throughout the 30's till it occupied 11 floors in 3 buildings, all on the same street as their original one-room maison de couture. In 1945, after the war had ended, it was very necessary to revive the glory of haute couture as well as raise money for war relief. Robert Ricci had an idea which Lucien Lelong, President of the Chambre, put into action. 172 dolls from 40 Paris couturiers, including Balenciaga and Madame Gres, were dressed in the latest fashions and an exhibition was held at the Louvre, in Paris. It was a great success and subsequently toured Europe and the USA. In 1959 the arrival of young designers, Jules-Francois Crahay, engaged by Madame Ricci brought new impetus to the Couture House. Crahay left Ricci in 1963 to go to Lanvin, and was replaced by Gerard Pipart, who had worked with Balmain, Fath and Jean Patou. He continued to design the most beautiful lace dresses with appliqu\u00e9d fabrics in the typically Ricci style, along with silk day dresses. Even after Nina Ricci died in 1970 at the age of 87, Pipart continued to design for the house of Ricci. Nina's son Robert, an expert perfumer as well as a businessman, has transformed the house into an empire the size of which his mother may never have dreamed. The house is a monument to his mother and reflects her intensely feminine personality. Robert Ricci died in 1988 at the age of 83. the label Mariano Puig, whose Catalan (Barcelona) family purchased the house of Nina Ricci in 1998, also owns the house of Paco Rabanne. Massimo Guissain worked as a designer, and Nathalie Gervais has been the chief designer for the house for several years, but presented her last collection for Fall 2001. In May 2002 American designer James Aguiar took over as chief designer and designed for two seasons. In 2003 Lars Nilsson took over with varying degrees of critical success. He resigned suddenly in early 2006, and in September of the same year, the house announced that Brussels-born fashion darling Olivier Theyskens\u2014whose home at Rochas was suddenly shuttered earlier this year\u2014would succeed, hopefully to translate his talent into the Ricci label.","the_look":"Working directly with the fabric on a mannequin, Nina Ricci created elegant, sophisticated clothes in classic style. She was noted for her high standard of workmanship and became a popular designer for older society women. She was skilled at making the most of a print, cutting a plaid for an evening dress on the bias, echoing the X-cross in the skirt pattern in the surplice, crossed-over treatment of the bodice. One daring dress in 1937 had a halter neck open between the breasts from neck to waist. Day and evening dresses alike drew attention to the figure, by being fitted to below the waist and featuring much shirring and drapery.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1946 Coeur Joir (W)","1949 L'Air du Temps","1949 Douce","1956 Fille d'Eve (W)","1960 Capricci (W)","1965 Signor Ricci (M)","1967 Mademoiselle Ricci","1967 Capricci de Capricci (W)","1971 Bigarade (W)","1973 Farouche (W)","1976 Signor Ricci 2 (M)","1982 Fleur de Fleur (W)","1982 Eau de Fleurs (W)","1984 Phileas (M)","1987 Nina (W)","1989 Ricci Club (W)","1989 Ricci Club (M)","1994 Deci Dela","1996 Belles de Ricci (Liberte Acidulel (W)","1999 Belles de Ricci (L'Almond Amour)(W)","1999 Belles de Ricci (Delice d'Epices)(W)","1999 Belles de Minuit (W)","2000 Belle de Minuit","2000 Premier Jour (W)","2002 Memoire d'Homme (M)","2003 Premier Jour Frisson d'Ete (W)","2004 Love in Paris (W)","2004 Love Fills l'Air du Temps (W)","2004 Les Belles de Ricci (Cherry Fantasy) (W)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Nina Ricci"]}

During a trip to New York in 1971 with his new friends, Blahnik was introduced to Diana Vreeland, then the editor-in-chief of US Vogue, by Picasso. At the time, Blahnik wanted to be a theatre designer but, once he had been persuaded to show her his sketches and after admiring the shoes he had on - a tiny Edwardian pair from Portobello Market - Vreeland insisted that he \"should concentrate on the funny little things on the feet\". And Blahnik obeyed. His first collection was designed for Ossie Clark in 1971, but over the years, Blahnik's shoes have graced the catwalks of the world's leading designers including Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, John Galliano and Michael Kors. He opened his first shop in 1973 by buying out an existing shop called Zapata in Chelsea. This boutique was on Old Church Street in London which soon became regularly frequented by Bianca Jagger, Marie Helvin and Jerry Hall. Blahnik became a pseudo-uncle to the baby Jade Jagger and would visit Bianca at home frequently. He even changed Jade's nappies. Now universally known as 'Manolo's', Blahnik's shoes are coveted by a long list of famous clientele from celebrities to royalty. Bianca wore them to make her famous Studio 54 entrance on a white horse in 1977, Diana, Princess of Wales wore them to the Serpentine Gallery in 1994 on the night that Prince Charles admitted his infidelity on television and Kylie Minogue wore them for the cover of her 2001 comeback album. Madonna once described shoes designed by Blahnik as \"better than sex\" and added that, \"what's more, they last longer\". Blahnik, known for a wit as sharp as the heels he is famous for making, simply responded: \"You have to admire her, she hides her lack of talent so well. Blahnik's status as a cultural phenomenon was reaffirmed when Marge Simpson wore a pair of his mules during a 1991 episode of The Simpsons. Later, his name became even better known when his designs took 'supporting roles' on the hit television shows Absolutely Fabulous and Sex And The City. A craftsman with an impeccable eye for detail, Blahnik plays the major part in the creation of his designs, from the initial sketches to creating his own advertising campaigns which always feature his drawings. During his 30-year career, they have become sought after in their own right, raising L10,000 at a charity auction in the United States in 2000. Yet, his business is remarkably small with only one shop in London and a second boutique in New York. Named Accessory Designer of the Year by the British Fashion Council in 1990 and 1999, Blahnik also has honorary doctorates from the Royal London College of Art and the Royal Society of Arts of Britain. In 2003, he was honoured with a retrospective exhibition of his drawings, memorabilia and collections at the Design Museum in London.","the_look":"Manolo Blahnik began his extraordinary career in the Seventies and continues to be a champion of timeless and beautifully crafted designs.

{"designer_name":"Marc Buchanan","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/marc-buchanan\/"],"biography":"  From the early age of two, it was apparent that Marc Buchanan had a desire to be involved in design and the fine arts. Painting, sculpting and ceramics were among his favorite past times and something he would develop in later years. But it was ultimately design that made his name known. \n By the time Buchanan reached his teen years, he demonstrated the makings of a true designer. He first learned his craft by picking up books and reading about design, pattern making and fabrics. That was not something uncommon for Buchanan who by the time he reached high school had already been designing clothes for himself. \n   Buchanan had always been an entrepreneur at heart. By 1971, Buchanan launched his first apparel company called Gandolf & Company, a men's and women's leather outerwear and sportswear firm. Buchanan owned and ran Gandolf until 1976, when he sold it to explore other interests. Buchanan began doing freelance design work, while at the same time, attending Cranbrook Art Academy for sculpture classes. Within two years, Buchanan was at it again. This time developing a leather outerwear brand that he would call Pelle Pelle. The brand would debut in 1978 and would later evolve into one of the leading young men's lifestyle brands of the 21st century. Buchanan keeps to the same design and philosophy principles of his early years: providing consumers with direction; creating extreme but tasteful wearable fashions and at the same time, keeping the integrity of his product. the label For over a quarter century, Pelle Pelle has been one of the most trusted names in the urban apparel industry. Since 1978, when owner and Chairman of the Board Marc Buchanan founded Pelle Pelle, the company has been providing the urban consumer with stylish and fashion forward products. Known for its high end quality leather jackets with state of the art graphics and incredibly soft leather, Pelle, in 1992 entered the sportswear market and pioneered the urban fit for jeans which now has become the industry standard. Pelle, which means leather in Italian, provides quality products for men, women and kids. Committed to providing high-end products to the consumer and world-class customer service to the retailer, Pelle Pelle continues to be an urban tradition.","the_look":"The global brand is recognized for its fashion-forward products, state-of-the-art graphics and high-end collectible jackets, and is a wardrobe favorite among major musicians and stars.

{"designer_name":"Marcel Rochas","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/marcel-rochas\/"],"biography":"  Marcel Rochas was born in Paris, France in 1902. He opened his house in 1924. He was encouraged by Jean Cocteau, Christian Berard and Paul POIRET. \n He was a strong, influential designer with an international reputation, who anticipated many of the most prominent fashion trends of the 20th century. \n   During the 30's, Rochas started to create black and white dresses that featured a white collar. His creative innovations often featured a strong shoulder line. In 1931, Marcel ROCHAS opened his fashion house to the 12 Matignon avenue. His customers are composed, amongst other things, stars Hollywood such as Carole Lombard, Marlene Dietrich and among others. For the actress Mae West, Marcel Rochas have created a black wasp-waisted corset of Chantilly. It appeared that the shapes of the woman have inspired him for the creation of the bottle of perfume \u00ab FEMME \u00bb. In 1933, his collection featured wide shoulders, a style generally attributed to SCHIAPARELLI. In 1935 the great fashion illustrator Cecil Beaton drew two Rochas gowns for Vogue. They show the typical thirties hem length at around mid calf, and the slinky silhouette so typical of the decade. He tried to show in his sketches, the luxurious fabrics and exquisite design which the house of Rochas was known for. Marcel favoured hourglass silhouettes and foreshadowed the new look of Dior, by showing longer skirts in 1941. In 1945 Marcel Rochas introduced a long strapless brassierre\/girdle which enclosed the hips. It was a foundation garment that was to train figures for a decade. It was in Europe and the United States, called the \"Waspie\". This was based on the very small waist a Wasp has. In France where it was introduced, this name was not used, it was called a \"guepiere\". In the 50's, he transposed casual trousers into the context of women's suiting - another Rochas novelty. Rochas often worked with flower-patterned fabrics. He promoted the three-quarter-length coat and was one of the first designers to feature pockets in skirts. Rochas also specialized in separates and accessories, which he sold from a boutique in his salon. Marcel Rochas died in 1955 at the early age of 53. However his house has continued to create clothing, perfumes and accessories. From 1955, Rochas' wife Helene tried to take over the designing, but was not able to continue for long. Various designers have worked for the house. In 1987 the German hair-care and cosmetics giant Wella bought the house of Rochas. Peter O'Brien joined the house of Rochas in 1989 and since then has been the chief designer. He studied at Central St. Martin's, London and Parsons, New York before working with Marc Bohan at Dior, Givenchy and Chloe. O'Brien presented the Rochas Spring\/Summer 2003 ready-to-wear collection during Paris Fashion Week in October 2002. This is a dress from that collection. In November 2002, it has been announced that Peter O'Brien is leaving the house of Rochas, and is being replaced by Belgian designer Olivier Theyskins. the company Rochas is a fashion, beauty, and perfume house founded in 1925 by Marcel Rochas, the first designer of 2\/3-length coats and skirts with pockets. It is currently owned by Procter & Gamble. The company found recent recognition for its fashion design when it chose Olivier Theyskens as its creative director in 2002. (In the years leading to his appointment, its clothes had not been considered notable). Theyskens, within his first few months, created an \"entirely new silhouette for the house\" that was French-influenced and elegant. His first full collection, for Fall 2003, was praised by style.com as \"ravishing\" and \"nothing short of magnificent.\" For the next several years, Rochas continued to garner praise among fashion critics and to attract loyal followers. In 2006, the Council of Fashion Designers of America awarded Theyskens the International Award. However, Theyskens' focus on \"demicouture\" (special pieces too costly to mass-produce but which may not meet strict couture rules regarding hand-stitching and numbers of fitting) was questioned by fashion insiders as a viable business strategy. His gowns, some of which were priced upwards of $20,000, were often out of reach for all but the most fabulously wealthy. Theyskens took a purer approach to fashion and did not rely (like many fashion houses) on accessory sales and cheaper sister lines for a steady stream of revenue. In July 2006, Procter & Gamble announced the discontinuation of Rochas' fashion division, shocking many in the fashion industry. One \"longtime designer,\" commenting anonymously in the New York Times, said of the closure, \"That sort of perfect, made-to-measure business can't exist today, which is really too bad. Everything is about business now, and fashion shouldn't have to follow normal economic models\u2014that's not the point. What happened to investing in beauty?","the_look":"His motto was \"Youth, Simplicity, and Personality,\" alternatively reported in the New York Herald Tribune (3 August 1948) as \"elegance, simplicity, and youth,\" but it was in many ways the characteristic of personality that differentiated Rochas from other designers of his era. His initial fame came in the 1920s and rested on his tailleur, accompanied with full, supple skirts.","who_wears_it":["Carole Lombard","Marlene Dietrich","Mae West","Nicole Kidman","Jennifer Aniston","Kirsten Dunst","Kate Bosworth","Jennifer Lopez","Rachel Weisz","Sarah Jessica Parker"],"perfumes":["1944 Rochas Femme","1948 Mousseline (M)","1948 Eau de Verveine(M)","1948 Moustache (M)","1949 Mouche (M)","1949 La Rose de Rochas (W)","1960 Madame Rochas","1969 Monsieur Rochas","1970 Eau de Rochas (W)","1971 Audace","1978 Mystere de Rochas (W)","1980 Macassar (M)","1984 Lumiere (W)","1987 Byzance","1991 Globe (M)","1993 Eau de Rochas pour Homme","1994 Tocade (W)","1995 Byzantine (W)","1996 Fleur d'Eau (W)","1996 Eau de Fan","1997 Tocadilly (W)","1998 Alchimie (W)","1999 Rochas Man","2001 Aquaman (M)","2002 Aquawoman (W)","2002 Absolu (W)","2003 Rochas Lui (M)","2004 Poupee (Doll) (W)","2004 Lui (M)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Marcel Rochas","Rochas"]}

{"designer_name":"Max Factor","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/max-factor\/"],"biography":"the designer \n Max Factor (or \"Faktor\") was born in Lode, Poland, in or around 1877. Unlike the birth date and birth place of his half-brother (Jacob, later known as John, also known as \"Jake the Barber\"), which were meticulously detailed in a federal court case, Max is simply known to have been born in Lodz, near the Russian border. \n Max Factor moved his family to the United States in 1904. Prior to this date he had a business in Russia selling was involved in doing makeup and selling hand-made rouges, creams, fragrances and wigs. It is said that his clientele included members of the Russian court, the Royal Ballet and the Imperial Grand Opera. \n   Max, the eighth of ten children, was apprenticed at the age of eight to a dentist-pharmacist and\/or a wig maker. Wigs became an important business for him and pharmacists of the day were also known to have dabbled in what, today, we would call \"health and beauty\" products. In 1904, the Max Factor moved his family to the United States. From New York and Ellis Island, where \"Faktor\" became \"Factor\", The Factors moved on to St. Louis where he obtained a concession at the St. Louis World's Fair selling perfume, makeup and hair goods. Factor's makeup attracted the attention of the theatrical community and his reputation spread. Around 1908 he moved his family to Los Angeles and set up shop near the new Hollywood film community. In addition to his own line of products, Factor became West Coast distributor for two established lines of theatrical makeup. Wigs and hair products continued to be an important part of his business. He rented (expensive!) wigs to movie companies who would give roles to his sons ... so they could keep an eye on the wigs to make sure they didn't disappear! Hollywood glamor photographer, Peter Gowland, recalls that his mother was among the women who sold their hair to Max Factor for his wigs. Max Factor developed a do-it-yourself wig fitting chart so that customers could order wigs by mail and be sure of getting a correct fit. But makeup was the product with which Max Factor is most closely associated. Inventive by nature and with a background in compounding, Max Factor developed breakthrough Hollywood makeup products. His thinner grease paint replaced the older, thicker grease paint and gave actresses a more natural look. Eventually twelve shades were available. During the 1920's with the help of his son, Frank, Max Factor began to offer his products to women outside the world of Hollywood. The company's lines consisted of wigs, false eyelashes (another Max Factor innovation), eyebrow pencils, lip gloss, pancake makeup and perfume. The company continued to innovate, being the first to develop makeup suitable for the new color films. In 1937, the year before Max died, a patent was obtained for the Max Factor \"Pan-Cake Makeup\". (The \"pan\" because it was originally sold in a small pan.) In 1938, the year of Max Factor's death, the new makeup made its appearance in Hollywood films. the label The cosmetic firm Max Factor was founded in 1909 by Max Factor, Sr., a Polish make-up artist for the Russian royal ballet who emigrated to the United States in 1904. Max Factor is presently a brand of Procter & Gamble Co. who purchased the company in 1991. In the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the glory years of Hollywood, Max Factor became intimately associated with the world of movie make-up. He created the first makeup for the movies in 1914, and coined the term \"makeup\", based on the verb, \"to make up\" (one's face). Jean Harlow, Claudette Colbert, Bette Davis, and virtually all of the major movie actresses were regular customers of the Max Factor beauty salon, located near Hollywood Boulevard. His name appeared on many movie credits, and Factor himself appeared in some cameos. Many of Max's celebrity clients also appeared in full-color magazine ads to promote his cosmetics, so the brand name Max Factor soon became world-renowned. Max Factor is credited with many cosmetic innovations, including Pan-Cake makeup, the mascara wand, and concealer. Even today, 2006, Max Factor's television adverts cross-promote the latest blockbusters in which their make-up is used.

She once wanted to be a primary school teacher before she became a fashion designer. \n When she became the wife of Burani Garment Group company's General manger, her life of fashion design began. \n   During the years of end of 1960s and beginning of 1970s, Burani was named the pet of Italian children's garments. Her design's activity reflects the children's innocence and made her dream of \"being king of the children\" during her childhood come true. In 1975, she began to be in charge of fashion design of the Burani Company. It was a chance meeting with photographer Peter Lindbergh that catapulted her to fame. The famed German photographer told Mariella Burani, \u201cher clothes was like seeing his mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s on a chic, modern girl who wore army boots on her feet.\u201d It was her years in Reggio Emilia where she attended schools since fifth grade that inspired Mariella Burani\u2019s designs. The dainty Reggio girls who dressed in grays and subtle hues on one side and the women of Cavriago who went to work on the fields and weeded the rice paddies on the other evoked an image of delicate yet strong women to Mariella Burani, and eventually, the combination of these two worlds became her design philosophy. Together with photographer Peter Lindbergh, Mariella Burani started a black and white theme on the \u201cMariella Burani woman\u201d \u2013 a woman who on the move, a woman who laughs and cries, a woman who dresses like a woman but has an androgynous streak.

He made 17 trips to India learning techniques for the intricate embroidery that features in his work. Alongside these trips, he freelanced with Monsoon for two years. \n In 1996, he launched his own label, showing a collection of fluid, bias-cut dresses and skirts as well as cashmere twinsets. The use of sweaters over such dresses suggests a nonchalant glamour, which allows his clothes to pass smoothly from day to evening wear. He called his first collection \"Electric Angels\". Every piece was handcrafted. \n   Matthew Williamson Company was founded in February 1997 by designer, Matthew Williamson and CEO, Joseph Velosa. In the Summer of 1997, a cold call to British Vogue led to a meeting Plum Sykes, the then fashion assistant at the magazine. Encouraged by her reaction to his ideas, Matthew created a small women\u2019s wear collection which resulted in a September fashion show comprising a mere 11 outfits. In Spring\/Summer 2003 he also presented in addition to his own collection a knitwear collection for Scottish cashmere company Ballantyne which is a conservative traditional brand who wanted Williamson to pep things up a little.

{"designer_name":"Martine Sitbon","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/martine-sitbon\/"],"biography":"Born in Casablanca in 1951, Martine Sitbon discovered Paris during adolescence. She dreamt of theatre and ballet costumes . While studying in school Ber\u00e7ot, she learned with enthusiasm stylisme methods. Armed with her diploma in 1974, Martine Sitbon set out to conquer the world. From New York to Hong- Kong, from India to Milan, she tested her talent as a fashion designer while collaborating with many companies in the ready-to-wear industry. Her ten years experience taught her all the steps of a successful collection and back in Paris in 1985, Martine Sitbon launched her own label. \n In 1997 she showed her fist fashion show in Japan during Tokyo Fashion Week. \n The same year she was appointed Creative Director at Chlo\u00e9, the collaboration continues for nine seasons. \n   In 1989 she held her second fashion show in Osaka, Japan. In 1990 she opened her first freestanding Martine Sitbon shop. The boutique is located at 13 rue de Grenelle in the 7th arrondissement in Paris with a surface of 200 m2. In 1997 she opened her new showroom at 6 rue de Braque in the 3rd Arrondissement (Marais) Paris. Sitbon's duality has made her an important force in fashion, with a successful record of collections, including a new menswear line in 1999. Fashioned after Brit rockers, the suits and separates had hints of feminity, just as her womenswear usually had underlying masculinity. 2000 she launched the first watch collection in collaboration with Citizen. In 2001 she opened a Martine Sitbon boutique in Seoul, South Korea, followed by two further shop-in-shops (women and men) at Galeries Lafayette and Boulevard Haussmann in Paris in 2002. A new collaboration arrived in the 21st century when Sitbon signed with Byblos to become its womenswear director in 2001. The appointment came at a time when Sitbon's own collections were increasingly well received. Her spring 2002 womenswear showing in Paris was another stunner with delicate shirts and camisoles, cinched dresses, and wide trousers for day, and eveningwear in darker shades of gold, coral, and black with elaborate beading and embroidery. In 2003 she held her last runway show of the house Martine Sitbon. Autum\/Winter 2004-2005 season at the Mus\u00e9e D\u2019Art modern de la ville de Paris (Museum of Modern Art, Paris). In 2004 Jimmy K.W. Chan created Rue du Mail. He took Martine Sitbon as Creative Director. The company was established at 5 rue du Mail in the 2nd Arrondissement in Paris. In 2006 the space Rue du Mail opened. In 2007 Marine Sitbon held her first Fashion show for Rue du Mail at the Couvent des Cordeliers during the Autumn\/Winter 2007 \u2013 2008 ready-to-wear shows in Paris.","the_look":"Although her early collections bore fairytale titles like Cinderella, it is rock music, especially of the 1970s, that has often been Sitbon's strongest inspiration. Her sculptural suiting, often based on masculine lines, underpins each season's looks but leathers, studs, and swirling sequins were present, emphasizing both her affinity with the music scene and her skilled use of luxury fabrics.\nSitbon's manipulation of delicate textiles, mixing soft pastel and metallic shades as artistically as fruitier colors. Her use of fine organzas, left to flow and ruffle in petal-like folds at the cuff and collars of blouses, was a recurring element in her work. \nThe freedom to use these sensuous fabrics comes from her strong Italian financial backing, enabling her to experiment with expensive 1970s decorative favorites like sequins and embroidery. In 1989 she punctuated cropped leather waistcoats with gold studs, manipulating Hell's Angel motifs to achieve more luxurious results. The idea was developed further in olive suede waistcoats with looped chains that hung down to the bright gold velvet skirts with which they were teamed, demonstrating the subtle use of color and shade pervading her work.\nIn the middle 1990s, Sitbon's rock preoccupations came into their own, in tune with retrospective trends that gave an edge to her signature use of flares and bell bottoms. She has shown them in everything from intricate pink and charcoal cut velvet to dazzling gold sequins. \nSitbon's work has always been carefully accessorized, with perspex-heeled platform sandals with black straps criss-crossing up the leg or with stringy leather or satin chokers. Her attention to detail inspires the trimmings she uses; a futuristic bent is also a recurring undercurrent with stretch fit leggings, tops and jackets in soft leather, stitched in circles and stripes, which emphasize the wearer's physique and give a starkly postmodern feel. A sculptural form continues in her suits, tailored to accentuate the shape of the body, like the soft Prince of Wales trouser suits in 1987 that exploited the cut of men's suits and, more severely, in fitted black jackets and miniskirts defined by white borders and flap pocket edges in 1990. Along with the simple raw silk trousers and supple blouses, they provided a classic foil to her more dandyish designs for Chlo\u00e9 and the more fantastic elements of her main line.\nThis ability to design strong daywear items as well as more luxurious garments has provided Sitbon with a wide customer base in Europe. She has skillfully manipulated fabrics and the mixing of very contemporary themes, masculine and feminine.","who_wears_it":["Cate Blanchett","Amira Casar","Zoe Cassavetes","Sofia Coppola","Lou Doillon","Kristen Dunst","Scarlett Johansson","Kate Moss","Anita Pallenberg","Vanessa Paradis","Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy","Tilda Swinton"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Byblos","Martine Sitbon","Rue Du Mail By Martina Sitbon"]}

{"designer_name":"Michael Kors","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/michael-kors\/"],"biography":"Michael Kors was born in Long Island, New York in 1959. He is half Scandinavian, half Jewish. His mother is Joan Krystosek Kors, a former model. \n He studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology. \n He had two aims as a child, to be a movie star or a fashion designer. He describes himself not as an only child, but as a companion to his mother, a former Revlon model and shopaholic, who brought him up alone. At 4 years old, he modeled in cereal commercials and by the time he was a teenager, he was taking the train to Manhattan to study acting. His grandparents would show him beautiful fabrics and show him the difference between quality and not. As a child he studied the fashion sketches in the New York Times newspaper. \n   He learned his fashion trade by working at Lothar's boutique, on 57th Street, New York. Celebrities like Cher, Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand came there to buy casual clothes. This gave him an insight into customer preferences and before long he decided he could design better clothes than they had in stock. 1981, Kors launched the Michael Kors womenswear line at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman. These sold on the spot. His clinging scaled-down jumpsuits called attention to the body which he then layered with jackets. Forking frequently with natural fabrics and neutral colours, Kors creates garments that are noted for the minimalist approach, yet the cut is curvaceous and designed to flatter. His separates are often practical - the body-hugging dress is worn with a more tailored jacket, other jackets double as shirts. Many of his designs are inspired by the great American sportswear designer Claire McCardell. He is a deeply cool, directional designer who makes sexy, sleek, sharp modern clothes. When Kors was discouraged that he could never find a well-cut pair of gray pants and a good cashmere sweater, he treaded into the menswear category. He included his menswear line in 1990 but in 1993 faced severe financial problems. He managed to bounce back. Later, in his 1998 fall collection, Kors dressed male models to interact with the female models. From there, Michael used his womenswear factories to create a trial menswear line and sold it at Bergdorf Goodman and his boutique. It was a hit. In 2002, the menswear line was officially launched. It is said that Michael takes inspiration from his line from the motion picture, Downhill Racer. The menswear line includes sweaters, tailored pants, and peacoats. In 1997, Michael Kors was named the first ever women's ready-to-wear designer and creative director for the French fashion house Celine. In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with blockbuster accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left in October of 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. He has designed for several films, the most recent being for Rene Russo in the Thomas Crown Affair. He has also opened a boutique in the London store Harvey Nichols. In 1999 LVMH (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton), owner of the Celine label, purchased a third of Kors' D5 signature business. Kors hoped the acquisition would boost his presence internationally as well as allow him to expand his licensing and advertising activity, neither of which he had pursued aggressively in the past. Wholesale sales for the Kors D5 signature labels in 1999 were $30 million, according to the New York Times, with sales growing 60 to 70 percent annually for two years. Kors sold an additional tenth of his business in 2000 to Onward Kashiyama USA, a licensee for the Kors by Michael Kors bridge line. The designer hoped the new relationship would support plans to expand further into Asia. Next came a Kors first\u2014the introduction of a women's fragrance\u2014launched in fall 2000 through licensee Parfums Givenchy. The debut was successful enough for Kors to expand into men's scents the following year. He had also begun showing men's clothing again, after a hiatus, as part of his women's runway show in spring 1998. In 2001, Kors\u2014who considers fragrances one of his most personal creations\u2014and Parfums Givenchy developed three new scents called Notes from Michael which could be worn in any combination or alone. In addition to fragrance, Kors has focused on expanding the rest of his licensed products since the turn of the century, including handbags, footwear, and eyewear, which all debuted in spring 2001. Recently, the Michael Kors brand has begun expanding. In addition to the Micheal Kors runway collection, the MICHAEL Michael Kors and KORS Michael Kors lines were launched in 2004. MICHAEL, though still considered upscale, is more reasonably priced and available to the public. The line is sold in department stores such as Nordstrom's, and Macy's. KORS is also sold in similar department stores and is considered the mid-tier line, between the runway and MICHAEL collections. The MICHAEL line includes women's handbags and shoes as well as women's ready-to-wear apparel. The KORS line contains footwear. In addition, Kors also created a fragrance for women in 2000 and a fragrance for men in 2001. The ad campaigns for Michael Kors often reflects the jet-set sportswear that Kors fans are fond of. Previous campaigns include the model Carmen Kass on the tarmac of an airport, on a safari in Africa, and relaxing on a yacht. Michael Kors has five collection boutiques in New York, Beverly Hills, Americana Manhasset, South Coast Plaza, and Natick Collection.","the_look":"Kors has been a minimalist working within a sportswear tradition. In this, he has perpetuated and advanced ideas of Halston, including strong sexuality. He particularly flattered the gym-toned body of the late 1980s and early 1990s in stretchy, simple dresses calling attention to the body within. Minimalists in art and architecture might seem to remove themselves from the figure and human proportion; the irony is that a fashion minimalist like Kors has drawn attention to the figure within.\nAlthough he has shown patterns, Kors prefers neutral color fields and emphasizes the apparel of the fabric with luxurious wools and cashmere for fall-winter and stretch and cotton for spring-summer. Leather in shirts, skirts, and jackets is essential for any Kors fall-winter collection; trousers are critical in all collections; and layering is important, even light layers in spring-summer collections. Kors' distinctive position as a leading minimalist in late 20th-century sportswear was achieved by the precise harmony of color and fabric in separates.\nThere has been some affinity between Kors and Donna Karan, both creating innovative bodysuits, sensual stretch skirts and tops, and other sportswear elements, as well as borrowings from menswear. In fact, Karan and Kors are somewhat similar in their menswear collections as well. They shared the dubious distinction of both offering bodyshirts (underwear attached to shirts) in menswear collections for fall 1992. If anything, Kors' minimalism was a little more referential than Karan's\u2014he deliberately evoked the glamor and sportiness of the 1930s, the \"Belafonte\" shirt of the 1950s, or vinyl clothing of the late 1960s. \nHis sportswear-based pragmatism has been particularly effective as a monitor to the sexuality of his clothing. A bare Kors dress or jumpsuit may be audaciously sexy, but tone it down with a neutral jacket or other cover-up and it can become suitable for the office. Conversely, Kors can take a simple skirt and blouse from the office setting into hot evening life with the addition of a leather jacket or a satin swing jacket. Kors creates the pretty, the sexy, and the highly practical, pure mastery in American sportswear.\nThroughout Kors' decades as a designer, he has maintained the same casual-yet-luxurious sensibility he has been known for since launching his business. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, fashion trends caught up with his longtime focus on feminine, elegant simplicity, and he finally moved to the industry forefront. Whether taking inspiration from the equestrian world or from Native American culture, he has remained constant in his use of luxurious, often unique fabrics to create upscale yet wearable pieces.\nSome observers have criticized Kors for being bland and predictable and for never departing from his focus on casual luxury, either in his work for Celine or for his own labels. Yet many praise his confidence in sticking with what he believes his customers want and remaining unaffected by short-lived trends. He always creates pieces that can be mixed and matched in unexpected ways\u2014day with night, summer with winter, big and bulky with silky and slim. Kors is proud his clothes are bought by a customer base that ranges from 20-somethings to much more mature women.","who_wears_it":["Celebrity clients like Barbra Streisand","Diana Ross","Cher","Sharon Stone and Gwyneth Paltrow","Jennifer Lopez","Heidi Klum","Catherine Zeta-Jones","Joan Allen","Jennifer Garner","Sigourney Weaver","Liv Tyler","Rene Russo"],"perfumes":["2000  Michael Kors (W)","2000  Michael Kors (M)","2001  Michael (W)","2001  Michael (M)","2001  Notes from Michael \"Glenplaid\"(W)","2001  Notes from Michael \"Houndstooth\" (W)","2001  Notes from Michael \"Tattersall\"(W)","2003  Kors(W)","2004  Sheer Michael (W)","2005  Island Michael Kors (W)","2007 Island Hawaii (W)","2007 Very Michael Kors (W)","2008 Michael Kors Very Pretty (W)","2008 Island Bermuda (W)","2008 Island Capri (W)","2008 Island Fiji (W)","2009 Chic (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Michael Kors Collection","Kors Michael Kors","Michael Michael Kors"]}

In 1903, she married Peter Gallenga, who was one of the first doctors specializing in Cancer treatment. \n Maria was an artist who started making clothes in 1914 showing them in Rome and in Florence where her studio was located in the Via de Tornabuoni. \n She frequently incorporated her signature into the pattern of her materials. She designed theatrical velvet cloaks and tea gowns, evocative of the middle ages. She drew inspiration from pre-Raphaelite works of art and showed her garments in art exhibitions. Gallenga's fabrics and garments reflect the passion for the Italianate past. \n   Gallenga's gowns were very much part of the 20's idiom. She was awarded with the Silver Medal at the Monza design exhibition in 1923. In 1928, Maria Gallenga along with Bice Pittoni and Carla Visconti di Modrone, founded the Boutique Italienne in Paris. It was active as a display window for Italian fashion till 1934. Maria Gallenga died in 1944 at the age of 64.","the_look":"Worn at a theatre opening in New York in 1916, a Gallenga \"moyen age\" gown attracted much notice for it's miraculous gold pattern which appeared to float on the weightless black silk and did not seem to be painted or woven. Such a garment became a Gallenga signature. These gowns had square, boat or V necklines, tong tapered or paneled sleeves and often panels of floating chiffon set into their side seams. \nThis 1916 tunic is made of gold silk embroidered in white at the neck and hem with orange crepe-de-Chine wrap stenciled in gold. They had Venetian glass mille fiore beads, sewn at the shoulders or sometimes at the wrist or hem. These beads were larger and heavier than those used by Fortuny. For these gowns Gallenga used silk velvet or crepe de Chine, sometimes dyed in ombre shadings and stenciled with up to 9 tons of gold and silver paint. \nHer husband, Peter Gallenga, was a professor at the University of Rome, who helped her devise the method by which the metallic paint seemed to float on the fabric, not tarnishing or flaking off. This stenciling which did not affect the depth of the velvet's pile, was applied in a variety of patterns. Most popular was a Gothic ironwork-inspired design of ovals, inside of which were birds and flowers.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Mary Quant","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/mary-quant\/"],"biography":"Mary Quant was the fashion designer and entrepreneur responsible for the \"London Look\" of the 60's. She was the inventor of the min-skirt and hot pants. She proclaimed \"good taste is death, vulgarity is life\" and summarized the fashion of the 60's as \"arrogant, aggressive and sexy.\" Although she is still designing today, she is largely known for her 60's creations. \n Mary Quant was born in London, England on February 11th, 1934. From 1950-1953 she attended Goldsmith's College of Art in London. After graduating, she worked for Erik, a London milliner. \n Meanwhile , Alexander Plunket-Greene and Quant had paired up with a friend named Archie McNair. When Greene, who later became her husband, inherited 5,000 pounds on his 21st birthday, the three decided to go into business together. They rented Markham House, a three-story building on King's Road in London's artist district, Chelsea. In Markham House, they opened a boutique on the first floor and a restaurant in the basement. They called the boutique Bazaar in 1955. Here she sold inexpensive, brightly coloured simple clothes which were immediate hits with young girls and boys. These included skinny rib jumpers, ready-to-wear short skirts and dresses, coloured tights, hipster belts, PVC garments and sleeveless crochet tops and hats. In 1957 she opened a second boutique. \n   In 1961 Mary Quant showed her first fur collection and launched her first wholesale company. In 1962 she presented her first collection for the American market. She also started to design for J.C. PENNEY of New York. Regardless of whether she invented these items, Quant was one of their major popularisers, largely thanks to the fact that Bazaar was a popular haunt for the fashionable \"Chelsea Set\" of \"Swinging London\". By 1961, Quant had opened a second Bazaar in Knightsbridge and by 1965 she was exporting to the U.S.. To keep up with demand, Quant went into mass-production, setting up the Ginger Group in 1963. Struggling to make ends meet and suffering ridicule from the press and some passers-by, Quant persevered. In less than ten years, her clothing designs was world famous, selling in 150 shops in Britain, 320 stores in the United States, and throughout the world: France, Italy, Switzerland, Kenya, South Africa, Australia, Canada, and more. From 1964-68 she designed for Butterick patterns. In 1965 she launched the mini-skirt in London. A fashion show was held aboard the royal yacht Queen Elizabeth and was a great hit. The same year, she took 30 outfits to the USA and the models in their thigh-high dresses stopped traffic on Broadway and in Times Square in New York. They were seen on American TV. She visited l2 cities in 14 days showing clothes to a non-stop dance routine with pop music accompaniment. She soon had built up a million pound industry, selling to nearly all the countries in the Western world and Japan, designing 28 collections a year. In 1966 Mary Quant received the O.B.E. for her services to the fashion industry, and went to receive this honour from the Queen dressed in a mini-skirt. She published a book \"Quant by Quant\" in 1966. The same year, she introduced her famous and highly successful cosmetics line, with it's striking daisy logo. She also launched a footwear line. In 1967 she opened another boutique. In 1970 she introduced hot pants, tight figure-revealing short shorts, made of knit or soft materials, worn with floor length maxi-coats allowed to swing open and knee high boots. These were an instant success. During the 70's and 80's Mary Quant continued to add to her product line, putting her Daisy logo on household furnishings, towels and sheets, knitwear, men's ties, eyewear, hats and even a mod version of the Barbie doll. In 1994 she opened the Mary Quant colour shop for cosmetics and beauty products. In 1996 along with many other designers and celebrities, she joined a product making individual masks which were sold for charity and raised quite a good amount. Her clothes have continued to sell well, even today, but she never again achieved the popularity and volume of sales that she did in the 60's. Her cosmetic line however, sells very well today. Mary Quant is now the CEO of the London house of Fraser. She also continues to work as a free-lance designer for various companies. At an age when most designers have put down their sketch pads, Mary still oversees all the creative aspects of her atelier just off London's King's Road. As part of the Queen's Jubilee celebrations, various fashion celebrities were alloted a year of the Queen's Reign. Mary Quant has been named Woman of the Year 1955. In 2000, she resigned as director of Mary Quant Ltd., her cosmetics company, after a Japanese buy-out. There are over 200 Mary Quant Colour shops in Japan, where Quant fashions continue to enjoy more popularity. Mary became a grandmother for the first time in August 2002, when her son Orlando Plunket-Greene had a son which they have called Lucas Alexander. All the fashion shows of leading designers in New York, London, Paris and Milan - for both Summer and Fall - have been copying Quant designs. She is not at all angry about it but says she thinks it is great.","the_look":"She was a wonderful advertisement for her own designs, her short dark Vidal Sassoon hair style with it's fringe and her easy-fitting young-looking blazer jackets, brief swinging skirts and pinafore dresses. \nQuant designs were slightly influenced by beat dressing but interpreted in a more considered sharper, varied style. Her concept was uncompromisingly young - ten years younger than the high fashion ideal. She designed for a girlish, less developed figure. Her dresses had simple, boat necklines or childlike, round or pointed collars and narrow shoulders and sleeves. \nSummer and evening dresses were frequently sleeveless and body shaping was very understated, shadowing the breasts and waist to giver a long-torsoed, slightly 20's silhouette and hip-level belts and seaming. The long-waisted look made her flared and pleated skirts look even shorter. They were in fact the shortest on record, and were worn with simple strap over shoes or long boots. \nMary's designs spoke for themselves, models enjoyed wearing her clothes at fashion shows. Her publicity and success made traditionally cautious designers alter their attitudes and want their own designs to appeal to the newly important, big spending 16 to 25 year old market.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1966  Mary Quant","1974  Havoc"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Madeleine Vionnet","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/madeleine-vionnet\/"],"biography":"Madeleine Vionnet was called the \"Queen of the bias cut\" and \"the architect among dressmakers,\" Vionnet is best-known today for her elegant Grecian-style dresses and for introducing the bias cut to the fashion world. \n Madeleine Vionnet was born in 1876 into a poor family in Chilleur-aux-Bois, Loiret. She began her apprenticeship as a seamstress atage 11. After a brief marriage at age 18, she left her husband and went to London to work as a hospital seamstress. Vionnet eventually returned to Paris and trained with the well known fashion house Callot Soeurs and later with Jacques Doucet. \n In 1912 she founded her own fashion house, \"Vionnet\", for a short time just before World War I. The House of Vionnet grew to employ over 1,100 seamstresses and was the first fashion house to create ready to wear (pret-a-porter) designs from haute couture for sale in the United States. \n   In 1922 Vionnet's extravagant designs were inspired by Greek vases and Egyptian frescoes. She invents a \"bias\" cut to make dresses that fit tightly at the waist and flare out into a bell-shape skirt. She designs \"seam decorations\" decorating visible seams in star or flower shapes in 1925. With her bias cut clothes, Vionnet dominated haute couture in the 1930s setting trends with her sensual gowns. Vionnet's vision of the female form revolutionized modern clothing and the success of her unique cuts assured her reputation. She fought for copyright laws in fashion and employed what were considered revolutionary labor practices at the time - paid holidays and maternity leave, day-care, a dining hall, a resident doctor and dentist. In 1939 Madeleine Vionnet is awarded the Legion d'Honneur, France's highest honour. Vionnet closed her house when the Second world war started but did not reopen after the war. She lived to the age of 99 and died in 1975. Till the end of her life, she continued to monitor and comment on haute couture, whose artistry she had done so much for and where she is remembered as one of the greatest designers of all time. Vionnet employed several talented illustrators. Muguette Buhler was one. Another illustrator who drew Vionnet's gowns which were published in the Paris fashion magazine \"Gazette du Bon Ton\" was Thayaht.","the_look":"Madame Vionnet is considered one of the greatest designers. She was an architect of fashion. She chose fabric and line based on the client and cut with mathematical precision. She made most of her designs on wooden puppets first, letting the shape fall around them continuously until she was satisfied. \nShe invented cutting on the bias which changed the fit of clothes forever. A bias cut meant that a Vionnet dress could be just slipped over the head and worn without underpinnings and fastenings. Her clothes came to life on the body. \nMadeleine Vionnet believed that \"when a woman smiles, then her dress should smile too.\" Eschewing corsets, padding, stiffening, and anything that distorted the natural curves of a woman's body, her clothes were famous for accentuating the natural female form. Influenced by the modern dances of Isadora Duncan, Vionnet created designs that showed off a women's natural shape. Like Duncan, Vionnet was inspired by ancient Greek art, in which garments appear to float freely around the body rather than distort or mold its shape. As an expert couturier, Vionnet knew that textiles cut on the diagonal or bias could be draped to match the curves of a woman's body and echo its fluidity of motion. She used this \"bias cut\" to promote the potential for expression and motion, integrating comfort and movement as well as form into her designs.\nVionnet dresses are displayed in museums around the world. They are almost abstract and seem to glide on the body with rhythm. Elaborate gowns would have a single seam, yet when worn were tied, draped, twisted and fell free. It was as though the fabric was feeling the body or the body was wearing air. \nShe had a deep knowledge of just how fabrics move and hang. She used supple silks and jersey. Her favourites were crepe, georgette, mousselin, organza and lame. Her fabrics were made specially in two metre widths to accommodate her bias cut.

{"designer_name":"Main Rousseau Bocher","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/main-rousseau-bocher\/"],"biography":"Mainbocher was an American couturier who operated fashion houses in Paris and later New York from the 1930s through the 1960s. \n Main Rousseau Bocher was born in Chicago in 1891. He studied art at the University of Chicago, the Chicago Acedemy of Dine Arts and the Art Students League in New York, From 1911 to 1917, he studied and worked in Munich, London and Paris. In 1917, he served with the American hospital unit en route to France and at the end of the war he stayed on in Paris, intending to study singing. The loss of his voice forced him to seek and alternative career. \n In 1922 he joined the Paris office of Harpers Bazaar as an illustrator and the following year, he was appointed the Paris fashion editor for the French VOGUE. By 1929 he felt he had learned all there was to know about fashion and left VOGUE. \n   In 1930 Bocher set up his own maison de couture at l2, avenue de Georges V, Paris. He joined his two names together to form MAINBOCHER and began to design gowns. He afterwards said that he had discovered Elsa Schiaparelli because he had published her drawing of an unusual sweater in VOGUE from which she started her career. Mainbocher wanted to keep his designs very exclusive and therefore invited only a select few people to attend his collections, and made them pay a large admission fee. His salon was exquisite, decorated with zebra skin rugs, mirrors, porcelain and fresh flowers. To these elegant surroundings came many celebrated ladies, most well-known being Wallis Simpson, later to become Duchess of Windsor. He created a special blue, the \"Wallis Blue\" for her. In 1938 he designed the Wedding dress and trousseau for Wallis Simpson when she married the ex King of England. During the 30's his was the place to go for clothes that were perfectly appropriate. He made a woman look every inch a lady. His mannequins wore spotless white gloves, strings of pearls, hairbands with flat bows and other discreet accessories that perfectly complemented his suits or evening gowns. His clothes projected elegance and confidence. As the war neared, Mainbocher moved from Paris to New York, where he was able to duplicate his success. He first established himself next to Tiffany on 57th street and in 1960 moved to 609 Fifth Avenue. He never had any other branches or licensing arrangements. He believed that his clothes should be worn with good jewelry and simple shoes. His sole non-clothing offering was his perfume White Garden, which was only available at his salon. Mainbocher worked by making sketches, using fabrics that he had chosen, and imagining the role a particular design might play in a client's life. He felt that suitability is the secret of being well dressed. His first collections were narrow bias-cut slip dresses in white or black patterned silks, and later, printed taffeta or crepe. In 1932 he produced a collection of cotton evening dresses, astonishing Paris with his checked gingham. He used men's shirtings, linen towelling and cotton pique for floor-length dresses with cutaway halter necklines,or evening coats cut like blazers. In 1934 he introduced the first strapless evening dress in black satin. This did not catch on until later in the decade. By the late thirties, he was making dresses with a curvy silhouette, big sleeves, ruffles, trains, gold kidskin evening wraps, etc. In his last Paris collection in 1940, he presented the cinched-in \"wasp\" waist. During the 2nd World War, he designed uniforms for several of the Services, Red Cross, Girl Scouts, and to keep within the fabric regulations made short evening dresses. During the50's his style seemed dowdy, skirts and jackets in soft wools, flat bows, Peter Pan collars,etc. Well into the 60's, his high-waisted, cowl and halter necked evening gowns were worn by his celebrated clients but he became more separate from other designers, since his were the most costly clothes of all the couture houses. Mainbocher retired in 1971 and moved to Europe, until he died in 1976. In the year 2000\/2002, the city of New York decided to honour 24 American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along the pavement of 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Mainbocher was one of those honoured.","the_look":"From the start, Mainbocher specialized in simple, conservative, elegant, and extremely expensive fashions, the luxury of cut, materials, and workmanship that could only be recognized by those in the know. Most importantly, the clothes, exquisitely finished inside and out, gave self-confidence to the women who wore them.\nMainbocher considered his contemporary Chanel too plebeian, and Schiaparelli too avant-garde. Instead, he admired Vionnet and borrowed her bias-cut technique for his own simple slip evening dresses in the 1930s. Twenty years later, a very similar slip design was employed by Mainbocher, produced in a signature elegant silk velvet fabric. From Augustabernard, another 1920s French dress designer, Mainbocher was inspired not only to form his name, but to use godets in skirts, and shoulder bows to catch the folds of draped bodices. Frequent Mainbocher suit treatments in the 1930s included short capelet effects or dropped shoulders widening into full sleeves. The designer knew his client\u00e9le personally and designed for the lives they led, specializing in evening clothes. For resort wear he ventured into a mix-and-match ensemble consisting of matching top, skirt, bathing suit, and hat. Slim, demure black wool dresses for daytime would sport white chiffon interest at the throat.\nWhile Mainbocher did use some Japanese-like kimonos as eveningwear during this period, his hallmark was nonaggressive, not exaggerated or period dressing. A touch of labor-intensive luxury would be bestowed by all-over sequins on an evening jacket or on a bare top worn discreetly under a jacket. The grayish-blue, \"Wallis blue,\" of the Duchess of Windsor's wedding dress, as well as the long, fluid crepe dress itself, was widely copied. The simple, conservative elegance of Mainbocher's style, feminine but not fussy, perfectly suited the slim, severe good looks of the Duchess and wealthy women like her. Additionally, she was honoring a fellow American.\nIn 1934 Mainbocher introduced the boned strapless bodice, and before the war forced him to leave Paris, a waist cincher, forming tiny waisted, pleated and skirted dresses that presaged Dior's postwar New Look. Mainbocher's arrival in New York coincided perfectly with the city \u00e9lite's love for French couture, for though he epitomized it, he satisfied their patriotism because he was actually an American. Society matrons such as C.Z. Guest and the Vanderbilts, and stage actresses such as Mary Martin, avidly patronized this \"most expensive custom dressmaker\" who made women look and feel exquisitely well-bred.\nAccedance to wartime economies resulted in Mainbocher's short evening dresses and versatile cashmere sweaters\u2014beaded, lined in silk, and closed by jeweled buttons\u2014designed to keep women warm in their bare evening gowns. Another practical wartime innovation, the \"glamor belt,\" an apron-like, sequined or bead-encrusted accessory, could be added to embellish any plain costume. \nAs the years progressed, Mainbocher continued to design exclusively on a made-to-order basis, refusing to license his name. La Galerie, a department in his salon, did produce clothes in standard sizes, a compromise for busy women without time for lengthy fittings. The reverse snobbery of the humble pastel gingham or cotton piqu\u00e9 used for fancy dresses appealed to Mainbocher's client\u00e9le, as did refined tweed suits with subtle dressmaker touches such as curved bands or fabric appliqu\u00e9s, worn with coordinating bare-armed blouses. A Mainbocher standby was the little black \"nothing\" sheath dress.\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, old guard Mainbocher customers enjoyed wearing impeccably made classic coats and suits of wool, often fur-lined, in the midst of nouveau-riche ostentation. The typical ladylike daytime Mainbocher look was accessorized by a plain velvet bow in the hair instead of a hat, a choker of several strands of real pearls, white gloves, and plain pumps with matching handbag. The integrity of luxurious fabrics, intricate cut, quality workmanship and materials, elegance and classicism, were cherished and worn for years by Mainbocher's upper crust customers.","who_wears_it":["Duchess of Windsor","Ethel Merman"],"perfumes":["1930  White Garden"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}

Junko and Hiroko Koshino are her two older sisters. While she was studying she worked in her mother's boutique to gain fashion experience. \n She graduated from Bunka Fukuso Gakuin, the Japanese College of design, in 1974. \n In 1975 she went to London and soon established Herself as a confident successful designer, able to merge Oriental and Occidental ides in a modern manner. \n   Staying away from mainstream fashion, she has a cult following. In 1987 Michiko started designing for menswear label Motorking and her Motorking creations are already collector items. Her 100's collection of limited edition pieces and the Yen Jeans manufactured only with original Japanese demin, continue to be commercial hits. She also designs for womenswear label Q tee inspired by street gangs and the urban environment. Her product lines include clothing, cosmetics, underwear, sunglasses and watches and are sold in Europe, Asia and North America. Additionally, she claims to be the first designer to market condoms under her own brand name. Some of Koshino's licensees for her main brand umbrella, Michiko London, include Sudo for wool and acrylic scarves, Ta Feng for umbrellas, Shin Myung Mool San for lighters, Chiyoda Bussan for footwear, Mandom for cosmetics, Gunze for tights, and Mitsubishi Rayon for casual apparel. Koshino's collections also offer a selection of different types of clothes, to provide a whole wardrobe for her customers. Her flagship store in Covent Garden, London, with its DJ mixing tables providing a direct link with the clubs, always shows her full range, spanning the biker-inspired Motor King collection, its title often emblazoned on the stark contrast leathers, the designer name t-shirts and sweatshirts popular with tourists, the sharp, brightly colored sits, and the sexier, more overtly clubby Lycra, viscose, and leather of the Michiko London range. Koshino's focus in the 2000s has been on three lines: Main Collection, Yen Jeans, and her 100's line.","the_look":"Koshino's greatest talent is undoubtedly her ability to absorb changing emphasis in fashion and respond with sexy sports-based clothing targeted at the waiting customers of the club scene through marketing ploys like fashion shows in clubs and promotional wear for companies like Vidal Sassoon.

And although Koshino has been described as \"ultra-hip\" and \"cutting edge,\" she often incorporates classic fabrics such as tweed and denim (the latter a favorite) into her jackets, quilted coats, bags, and other items.

She studied art at the University of Washington, designing theatre costumes on the side, before moving to New York. Her first jobs were in fashion illustration for Vogue and Harpers Bazaar. \n In 1925 and 1926, Bonwit Teller ran a series of advertisements depicting ladies tea dancing, attending the Kennel Club Show and leaving for Palm Beach on trains. These were drawn by illustrator Muriel King. \n In 1927, Muriel spent the first of 3 annual 8 month stays in Europe where she free-lanced as a fashion artist for Modes and Manners, Femina and French Vogue. \n   Urged on by friends, she began designing clothes professionally. She worked by making her beautifully rendered drawings first and then had the clothes made up by her staff. Customers ordered from the sketches and she often worked with American fabrics. In 1932, Muriel was chosen as one of the first 3 designers for Lord and Taylor's promotion of American fashion. She had just gone into business for herself, opening a salon at East 61st Street, New York. Lord and Taylor sold her ready-to-wear designs priced at between $ 20-50 and her private clientele could order dresses that were exclusive, at higher prices. She designed an entire collection in 1933 for B. Altman, everything from bathing suits and skating clothes to evening gowns. Muriel was especially interested in interchangeable wardrobes of separates and day-into-evening clothes. A dinner dress is shown in the picture here, from 1938, which emulated a 19th century Spencer with the high curve of the waistline. The lower portion of the dress with it's striped fabric, appears to be a separate skirt, reflecting the casual ethos of sportswear in the late 30's. Beginning in 1935, she designed the personal wardrobe for film star Katherine Hepburn, as well as for her film \"Sylvia Scarlett\". Here on the right, is a trouser outfit she designed for Hepburn, who was very fond of trouser suits. She also designed for Ginger Rogers for the movie \"Stage Door\" in 1937. In all, between 1935 and 1944, she designed costumes for 8 movies, including \"Cover girl\" in 1943 with Rita Hayworth starring. Here on the left is a sketch of a Muriel King gown of 1937 which appeared in Vogue. The illustrator who made the sketch was Ruth Grafstrom. In the 1940's Muriel King started a venture called d'Armand King. During World War II, she designed a wardrobe of co-ordinated garments in \"flight blue\" for women aircraft workers which were used by Boeing, Lockheed and Douglas aircraft makers. King freelanced for Lord and Tailor and after the War became head designer for Stein and Blaine. By the 1950's her designs were considered respectable, dignified and mature not sexy and innovative. In the fashion industry this is the kiss of death. In 1957, she retired from fashion design to concentrate on her painting. She died in 1977 at the age of 76.","the_look":"Muriel King's clothes were breathtakingly elegant, with none of the gimmickry that marred other American designs.

Magnin specialty stores. \n Katz started Martin Katz, Ltd. in 1988. He began by making house calls to his few clients or inviting them into in his home. The panoramic view from his Beverly Hills penthouse apartment was the ideal complement to what Vogue dubbed the \u201cJewel Bar\u201d. He opened his first retail store in Beverly Hills in 1998.

Both have appeared in television and films since infancy. Since then, they have continued their celebrity through numerous television programs, films, interviews, as well as commercial endorsements. Although they are virtually identical in appearance, they are genetically different fraternal twins. (They prefer the term \"individual pair\".) \n As the sisters have matured, there has been greater interest in their fashion choices, with the New York Times declaring Mary-Kate a fashion icon for pioneering her signature (and now popular among celebrities and fans alike) \"homeless\" look. The style, sometimes referred to as \"ashcan\" or \"Boho-chic\" or bohemian-bourgeois, is similar to that of Bohemian chic popularized in Britain by Kate Moss and Sienna Miller. The look consists of oversized sunglasses, boots, loose sweaters, and flowing skirts all with an aesthetic of mixing high end pieces with low end. Their fashion choices, however, have not been without controversy. Ashley Olsen was included on PETA's 2006 Worst Dressed list for wearing fur. \n Mary-Kate and Ashley have a clothing line in Wal-Mart stores across North America for girls ages 4 \u2013 14 as well as a beauty line called \"Mary-Kate and Ashley: Real fashion for real girls\". In 2004 they made news by signing a pledge to allow all the workers that sew their line of clothing in Bangladesh full maternity leave. The National Labor Committee, which organized the pledge, later praised the twins for their commitment to worker rights. The director of the organization, Charles Kernaghan, is quoted as saying, \"The Olsen twins have done the right thing. Now it is up to Wal-Mart to either support Mary-Kate and Ashley\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s rights, or tragically to shut them down.\" \n   They were tapped as the faces of upscale fashion line Badgley Mischka in 2006, in an attempt to gain credibility in the fashion industry after their association with Wal-Mart. They have also launched their own new couture fashion label \"The Row\" named after the famous Savile Row of London.

{"designer_name":"Mikimoto K333Kichi","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/mikimoto-k333kichi\/"],"biography":"Mikimoto K\u014dkichi was a Japanese entrepreneur and adopter of the Mise\/Nishikawa technique for production of synthetic cultured pearls. \n Born as the first son of an udon shop owner in Toba, Shima Province (present-day Mie prefecture), Mikimoto left school at the age of 13 and sold vegetables to support his family. Seeing the pearl divers of Ise unloading their treasures at the shore in his childhood started his fascination with pearls. \n In 1888, Mikimoto obtained a loan to start his first pearl oyster farm at the Shinmei inlet on Ago Bay in Mie prefecture together with his wife and partner Ume. On 11 July 1893, after many failures and near bankruptcy, he was able to create the hemispherical cultured pearls. He introduced these mabes at a marine products exposition in Norway in 1897, and began an export business. However, it took him another 12 years to create completely spherical pearls that were indistinguishable from the highest quality natural ones, and commercially viable harvests were not obtained until the 1920s. \n   Mikimoto did not know that government biologist Tokishi Nishikawa and a carpenter, Tatsuhei Mise, had each spent time in Australia and learned the secret to spherical pearl production from expatriate British marine biologist William Saville-Kent -- that inserting a piece of oyster epithelial membrane (the lip of mantle tissue) with a nucleus of shell or metal into an oyster's body or mantle causes the tissue to form a pearl sack. The sack produces nacre, which coats the nucleus, thus creating a pearl. Mise received a 1907 patent for this grafting needle. When Nishikawa applied in the same year, he realized that Mise had already secured a patent. In a compromise, the pair agreed to cooperate, calling their discovery the \"Mise-Nishikawa method\". Mikimoto had previously received a patent in 1896 for producing hemispherical pearls, or mabes, and a 1908 patent for culturing in mantle tissue, but he could not use the Mise-Nishikawa method without invalidating his own patents. Mikimoto then altered his patent application to cover a technique to make round pearls in mantle tissue, which was granted in 1916. However this method was not commercially viable. Mikimoto finally made arrangements to use Nishikawa's methods after 1916, and Mikimoto's business began to expand rapidly. The new technology enabled Japan's cultured pearl industry to quickly expand after 1916, and by 1935 there were 350 pearl farms in Japan producing 10 million cultured pearls annually. By 1935 the Japanese pearl industry was facing oversupply issues and plummeting prices for Japanese cultured pearls. Mikimoto promoted Japanese pearls in Europe and the USA in an attempt to counteract falling prices. He publicly burnt tons of low quality pearls as a publicity stunt to establish a reputation that the Mikimoto company only sold high quality cultured pearls. In 1899, the first Mikimoto pearl shop opened in the fashionable Ginza district of Tokyo selling natural seed pearls, and half round pearls. The Mikimoto business expanded internationally, opening stores in London (1913). After World War II Mikimoto opened in Paris, New York, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai and Bombay, and was thus one of the first Japanese brands to attain an international presence and recognition. However, Mikimoto had to constantly fight allegations that his pearls were only \u201cimitations\u201d of real pearls, despite scientific reports to the contrary. Mikimoto took advantage of every opportunity to personally promote his pearls, and took part in the 1926 Philadelphia World Exposition in which he displayed a replica of the \"Liberty Bell\" covered with pearls. Just before his death, Mikimoto was awarded the Order of Merit (First Class) by the Japanese government. On 21 September 1954, Mikimoto K\u014dkichi died at the age of 96. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Mikimoto"]}

Salinger of the fashion world, and rightly so -- he refuses to be photographed and will only be interviewed by fax. He won't even put his name on his clothes, branding them instead with a blank label. Margiela is perhaps the most underexposed designer around. But, in another way, he's continually overexposed, as his collections routinely reveal the designer's techniques and interests in their very construction. Bearing visible stitches, exposed hems, tailor's markings, and external shoulder pads, his collections never fail to both shock and delight. Margiela was born in Belgium in 1957. Early in his career, he became part of the Antwerp Six, an important fashion group whose other members included Dries van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester, and Walter Van Beirendonck. In 1984 he joined Jean-Paul Gaultier's design team, an experience that would profoundly shape his fashion sense. Leaving Gaultier in 1988, Margiela launched his own label, which soon became known for its stand-out, theme-oriented collections. His \"Flat Collection\" moved sleeves and armholes to the front, so garments would lie perfectly flat when not worn. His 1996 \"Photoprint Collection\" consisted of crepe garments printed with images of fur coats and heavy sweaters. Other collections have used broken dishes and bacterial mold; still others have featured no new designs, only favorite pieces from previous collections that have all been re-dyed gray. Margiela always puts on a show, using vacant lots and old subway cars as runways, and marionettes and hangers as models. In 1997, Margiela was hired to design the women's ready-to-wear line for Herme's. His first Herme's collection proved he could color inside the lines when required to; it was as horsy and conservative as Herme's could wish.

{"designer_name":"Miriam Haskell","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/miriam-haskell\/"],"biography":"Miriam Haskell was an American designer of costume jewelry. Like Hattie Carnegie, Haskell founded her own company, one that still bears her name. With her creative partner Frank Hess, she invented affordable pieces of stunning originality from 1920 through the 1950s. Vintage examples and samples of Miriam Haskell designs are now much sought, held in both private collections and museums internationally. \n Miriam Haskell's intricate designs were noted for the superior quality of their materials using tiny pearls and carved glass together with the exquisite detail of their execution, wiring complex motifs built up of beads and strass montees to filigree backings, all hand assembled by her team of craftsmen, many of whom were European refugees that she always paid well.  Therefore, she was able to command higher prices than her costume jeweller counter parts on these, but Miriam was most recognised for her baroque pearls and her Russian gold colouring of metal, a quite different attractive colour gold plate.  Interestingly, her jewellery was very seldom signed before 1950.  It was her brother Joseph Haskell who introduced the first regularly signed Miriam Haskell jewellery.  For very short time during the 1940s, a shop in New England did in-force a signature on the jewellery by Miriam.  However, the signed pieces of this period constituted less than 1% of the early jewellery, the short-term signature was a horseshoe-shaped plaque with Miriam Haskell embossed on it. A piece with this signature would indeed be a rare find.  Haskell Jewellery, although created with non-precious materials and stones, were so stunning that even wealthy ladies such as Gloria Vanderbilt and the Duchess of Windsor were loyal customers.  From the 1920s through to the 1960s her pieces were worn for publicity shots, films and movie stars Lucille Ball and Joan Crawford, who owned a set of almost every Haskell ever produced, were also personal customers. \n Haskell's lovers included Florenz Ziegfeld, who decorated the chorines of his Follies with her designs; Bernard Gimbel of the department store chain; and John D. Hertz, Jr., scion of the car-rental company. With Hess, she traveled in search of materials to Paris, Gablonz, Venice, and Wattens, home of Daniel Swarovski's crystal factory. She built a mansion that she called Sainte Claire Cottage on the Hudson River near Ossining. When the Ohio flooded in 1937, Haskell sent boxcars full of relief materials to New Albany, and traveled home to assist during the disaster. In World War Two, she contributed most conscientiously to the war effort, and asked Hess to create new patriotic metalfree jewelry designs, using natural materials and plastics. \n   But the horror of World War Two began to affect her health and emotional stability; in her fifties, she became ill, despite a prescient adherence to health food. At last, in 1950, she lost control of her company to her brothers. Living in an apartment on Central Park South with her widowed mother through the next decades, she became increasingly erratic in her behavior. In 1977, she moved to Cincinnati, under the care of her nephew Malcolm Dubin; bereft of New York and the work she loved, she died in 1981.

She is also currently working on fabric printing techniques.\nMiriam makes no attempt to find a rigid definition for her work, nor does she have a particular type of person in mind when designing; her work consists of using clothes as a means of expression and communication, creating a balance between fabrics, forms and on many occasions the designs themselves.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/miriamocarizmiguel","brands":["Miriam Ocariz"]}

He showed his collections on the international stage in New York and Paris in the Eighties and his label Nicole, still has a large presence in Japan. \n Known for his soft, yet structured, architectural sense of clothing, Matsuda was a fashion forerunner whose unique, naturalistic and earthy color sense influenced many other designers who followed him. \n Probably more than any other designer, Matsuda blazed a path in sunglasses with his Japanese sensibility and high tech pop aesthetic. His vintage shades remain cult collector items for connoisseurs of sunglasses. \n   Matsuda was born in Tokyo in 1934. An ambitious youth, he studied at Japan\u2019s famed Bunka school of fashion where his fellow classmates included Kenzo Takada and Junko Koshino. In the mid-eighties he was the architects\u2019 fashion designer, admired for his sense of structured silhouette, suits memorable for their arty nuances and crisp white shirts with unique fa\u00e7ade detailing. Perhaps his lack of English hemmed him back, and his commitment to a particularly understated oeuvre prevented him from winning a larger audience among the mass public, but he will be remembered as a distinctive Eastern voice, who foretold the marriage of fashion and architecture, which is so prevalent today. In 1964, Matsuda and Kenzo sailed from Japan to Europe to make their way to Paris, the great beacon of fashion. After some six months, Matsuda returned to Japan, with no money, while Kenzo stayed. Back in Japan he founded his own fashion company, Nicole Co. Ltd in 1967. Matsuda's aesthetic and cultural allegiance outside of Japan is not to Paris, but to England and America. His first company outside of Nicole Company in Japan was Matsuda USA which opened a Madison Avenue boutique in 1982. Matsuda has delved into the Anglo-American sportswear traditions as ardently as any designer, even as much as Ralph Lauren. In the mid-1990s Matsuda sought to expand its brand throughout the U.S. and Europe, which included moving menswear designer Yukio Kobayashi, who had begun designing some womenswear, to the head all of the women's labels (Madame Nicole, Nicole Club, Nicole Sport and Zelda) in 1995. Matsuda himself also continued to design for women, but for the Asian markets. The following year, on a trip to New York, Matsuda scouted locations for possible stores. Though the Nicole brands (Madame Nicole, Nicole Sport, Boutique Nicole and others) were available in Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys, as well as 500 stores in Asia and Europe, Matsuda hoped to bring his unique designs and growing licensed products to the U.S. in company-owned boutiques. Matsuda clients are ardently loyal, and his creations are profoundly progressive\u2014the perfect combination for New York fashion and beyond.

This is the story of Moise Emquies. Strange but true, it took an attorney with no fashion experience to create the world's perfect t-shirt. So perfect, in fact, that it became the prototype for the entire Splendid t-shirt collection. \n In 1992, Moise Emquies was a law school graduate waiting for the results of his California bar exam when his friend invited him to pass the time by designing a t-shirt for her clothing store. He threw himself into the project, quickly educating himself on textiles in search of the perfect rayon t-shirt on which to put his design. He found the best quality fabric that he could and his first design quickly sold out. In the meantime he landed his first job at a law firm but the success of his first foray into fashion left Emquies curious about the possibilities of designing for a living. \n Emquies began designing more and more t-shirts for his friend's boutique in his spare time, always trying to take fabrications to the next level. This led to the creation of his first fashion company, Leopold, which he owned for nine years. It was also through Leopold that Emquies met and hired Pamella Protzel, the woman who would become the head designer for another label he currently owns, ella moss. \n   Splendid is the culmination of Emquies' tireless search to find the softest fabric and most color absorbing yarns in the world in order to create the ultimate t-shirt. After an exhaustive ten year search, he finally discovered the right combination: 50% supima cotton (a luxurious cotton that gives the fabric body) and 50% micro modal (a form of rayon that is super soft and deeply absorbs dyes). It was then that Emiquies finally decided on a name for his new t-shirt collection: Splendid. In 2002, a full t-shirt collection with nine basic bodies was launched and has since grown to become an extensive collection of not only t-shirts but tanks, thermals, dresses, shorts and more. Clean, simple and effortless best describe the aesthetic of the line, which can be seen in countless magazines, movies and television.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Gwyneth Paltrow","Sarah Jessica Parker","Cameron Diaz","Kirsten Dunst","and Julia Roberts"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Splendid"]}

{"designer_name":"Maurice Ohayon","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/maurice-ohayon\/"],"biography":"For Maurice Ohayon, denim is a true passion. In 2003, after twenty-five years of working with denim, reining in its natural tendency to warp, mastering different washes, and pioneering new cutting techniques, he founded Notify. \n Ohayon was born in 1959 in Casablanca, Morocco. His mother worked as a men\u2019s tailor from home, measuring her customers, advising them on the styles best suited for their body types, and cutting muslin patterns for their fittings. The huge family dining room table was transformed during the day into a cutting surface around which employees and apprentices bustled about, creating buttonholes, setting linings, and sewing on pockets. \n The whole house lived according to the rhythm of the suits, their fittings, and the stress of last-minute alterations. Ohayon based the fundamentals of his craft on his childhood memories. \n   In 1973, his family moved permanently to Paris, and in 1976 Ohayon began fashion school, where he learned the ins and outs of mass production. Three years later, his diploma in hand, he set out to open an atelier like the one he remembered from his childhood. With a friend, he leased a space in Paris\u2019 Eleventh Arrondissement, bought used machinery, and launched the brand Fetiche. One day, a fabric supplier put in his hands a strange bolt of stiff material whose indigo color stained their fingers: denim. From that moment on, Ohayon had to revise everything he knew about fabrics. It would take him four years to master the principles of cutting, assembling, and shrinking denim. Twenty-five years later, Maurice Ohayon remains fascinated by this material, which he has come to know like the back of his hand. With Notify, Ohayon seeks to apply to jeans the tailoring techniques that he learned from his mother. Ohayon favors exacting cuts, traditional handmade details, and superb craftsmanship. He believes that pockets are very important\u2014his mother would often say that \"the air of a man depends upon the right balance of his pockets\u2019 shape and positioning.\" Ohayon embroiders the name of his brand on the inside waistband of each pair of jeans, just like his mother used to do with the name of her clients inside their suits. This mix of modern fashion and old-world details has made Ohayon an international success","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Notify"]}

Centred around an old mill, the company specialized in producing high quality woolen fabrics. \n Antonio (nickname Nino) was born there in 1930 in Biella, Italy. He was the eldest grandson of one of the brothers. Cerruti initially studied philosophy and had wanted to become a writer, however when he left University, he joined the family firm, at the age of 20 years, in 1950. The start of the company's transformation into a luxury label, came in 1957 when Cerruti launched a range of menswear called Hitman. \n   During the 50's he continued to prosper, in his spare time also designing the costumes for 4 plays he commissioned. In 1963, he launched a knitwear line. During the period 1961 to 1970, a young designer named Giorgio Armani joined his firm, and learned about designing. By 1967, he was ready to launch ready-to-wear, initially for men and nine years later, in 1976 for women. He also set up his studio in Paris in 1967 so that his garments would reach the French market. In 1980 the Cerruti Sports Line was launched. Making clothes for films was also one of his important contributions to fashion. Among around 60 films he has designed for, are \"Witches of Eastwick\", Wall Street and Baby Boom. Cerruti says \"ultimately, fashion is a way of describing the world we live in.\" In 1995, the Cerruti Jeans line was launched. In 1996 the Couture Arte line for men and women was launched. In 1996, Cerruti brought in a new young designer named Narcisso Rodriguez whose first collection was so sensational that Cerruti was again in the limelight. He brought an American sensibility to a well-established European house. Rodriguez worked alongside the company's founder, who is much loved by the Hollywood establishment. He dresses the half of the world that Armani doesn't, they share half and half. However, Rodriguez' world-shaking designs scared off some of Cerruti's customers and his personal acclaim was not much appreciated by Nino Cerruti, so his contract was not renewed. In 1997, Nino brought in another young designer to help him run the house. He was Peter Speliopoulos, a Greek, born in 1961. He gave the label a fresh modern look which was all about fine detail and exquisite fabrics. He was constantly traveling between New York and Paris and his designs were a reflection of his fast-line lifestyle. In 1998, the Cerruti New York showroom was opened and in 1999 a Boutique on Madison Avenue, New York. After over 100 years as a family business, Nino Cerruti retired and sold his business to Finpart in June 2001. the label In June 2001 they brought in Roberto Menichetti as Creative Director in September 2001, but he only stayed 6 months and resigned in March 2002. The designer appointed in August 2002, was Yugoslavian Istvan Francer, who spent 14 years from 1987 to 2001 with Donna Karan. Istvan Francer presented his first Cerruti ready-to-wear collection Spring\/Summer 2003 collection in Milan Fashion Week in September 2002 which was very well received. Francer's own label has been temporarily suspended and he put his heart and soul into the Cerruti show during Milan Fashion Week in March 2003.

{"designer_name":"Narciso Rodriguez","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/narciso-rodriguez\/"],"biography":"  Born in 1961 in New Jersey of Cuban-american parents. He was the son of a Cuban dock worker who came originally from the Canary Islands..He grew up in a poorer part of New Jersey. His parents were not very enthusiastic about his chosen career, fashion design. Fashion is not a very macho pursuit in Cuban society. \n Narciso Rodriguez received his formal education at the famous Parson\u2019s School of Design in New York. He started his career as a designer under Donna Karan at Anne Klein, then switched to Calvin Klein where he worked on that designers coat collection and fur line (since discontinued). In 1995, Rodriques became design director of Tse where he presented ready to wear collections for men and women in New York. \n   Simultaneously, Rodriguez was appointed design director of Cerruti in Paris. It was at Cerruti that Narciso received worldwide attention when he designed the bias-cut sheath wedding dress that his friend Carolyn Bessette would wear when she married John Kennedy, Jr. This did not go down very well with Nino Cerruti, so he did not renew his contract. Cerruti's loss was ABS's gain. ABS is America's best loved copy cat brand name manufacturer. It sells versions of the real thing for much lower prices. In October 1997, the first women\u2019s ready to wear collection under the Narciso Rodriguez label, in partnership with Italian manufacturer Aeffe factories of Alberta Ferretti, was presented in Milan for the Spring\/Summer 1998 season. Following the collection, Rodriguez was awarded \u201cbest new designer\u201d at the Vogue\/VH1 fashion awards in New York and the \u201cPerry Ellis award\u201d for best new designer by the council of fashion designers of America. Loewe, the Spanish leather luxury house established in Madrid in 1846 and owned by LVMH since January 1997, appointed Rodriguez as design director of the women\u2019s ready to wear collection. The first runway presentation for Loewe was held in March 1997 during the Paris Fall\/Winter 1998 season. In early 2001, Narciso Rodriguez declined to renew his contract with Loewe. In September 2001, AEFFE (Italy) agreed to finance production of his own label which started with Fall 2001 to great acclaim. For his Fall\/Winter 2001 ready to wear collection, Narciso Rodriguez decided to return to New York. Narciso is the first designer in history to receive the womenwear designer of the year award by the council of fashion designers of America consecutively in 2002 and 2003.

{"designer_name":"Nicolas Ghesquiere","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/nicolas-ghesquiere\/"],"biography":"Nicolas Ghesquiere (born 1971, in Comines, Nord-Pas de Calais, France, raised in Loudun, Poitou-Charentes, France) is a globally recognized fashion designer and is currently creative director for the house of Balenciaga owned by the Gucci Group (Pinault-Printemps-Redoute). \n He was the son of a Francophone Belgian golf-course owner and manager in the 9,000 inhabitants Poitevine town of Loudun and a French mother who enjoyed fashion. From a young age Ghesquiere enjoyed and practised sports (horse riding, fencing and swimming) and many of his collections use that inspiration, most notably his scuba minidresses and most recently his equestrian inspired Fall\/Winter 2006 Ready-To-Wear collection. He said himself that he loved the elegant fencing clothes. \n Raised in the small town of Loudun in western France (in the Poitevin-Saintongeais-speaking part), Ghesquiere announced at the age of 12 that he wanted to be a designer, though he now admits this was partly from an adolescent desire to do something different from his parents and to alleviate country boredom. So that's by the age of 12 that Nicolas was dreamily sketching dress designs in his school books, making dresses out of his mother's curtains and making earrings out of his grandmother's chandelier crystals. \n   He diligently did internships during his school holidays. At 14, he got an internship with French designer Agnes B for which he was paid in clothes. His next apprenticeship was with Corinne Cobson, afterwards he decided that fashion was too hard work and came home to finish his schooling. After completing his studies, Nicolas worked from 1990-1992 as an assistant to designer Jean-Paul Gaultier. He then worked at P\u00f4les, designing their knit wear line followed by a series of inauspicious assignments with different companies including the Italian house of Callaghan. Through his contacts with Marie-Am\u00e9lie Sauve and Nathalie Marrec, of Balenciaga, Ghesquiere eventually landed a job doing the licensing for Balenciaga (the unglamorous, mass-production side of fashion) and designing for the Asian market. In 1997, at the young age of 25, Ghesquiere was the surprise choice to head Balenciaga. Promoted to creative director of Balenciaga after his Belgian predecessor Josephus Thimister was fired following a disastrous show featuring an ear-splitting live band which quickly emptied the room. At that time, Balenciaga was owned by Groupe Jacques Bogart, in bad shape, and its heads realized his talent when he designed a small collection for one of their Japanese licences. He is known for his sense of silhouette, pairing highwaisted skinny pants with a voluminous blouson, or a tightly cut wool jumpsuit with billowing sleeves. Consistently reinventing himself by moving in new directions, he turned Balenciaga completely around. An aspect of the designer's devotion to the house's legacy is his respect for Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga's unyielding elegance and inventiveness. However, even though the Balenciaga archives are stored in Ghesquiere's atelier, he can gain entry to the locked room only by special appointment with an off-site custodian. Yet, he likes to repeat and tries to prove he's far from being a nostalgic and uses his \"child of the 80s\" (as he describes himself) memories, his vision of fashion's future in his creation a lot. Ghesquiere looks to the future in his collections with a mix of elements of science fiction, organic forms and French classicism. The Gucci Group (PPR) bought Balenciaga in 2001. Ghesquiere who wanted to stay and expand Balenciaga could only be bought through the house. \u201cIt is a happy relationship,\u201d Ghesquiere says. \u201cIt has worked because they wanted me to explain what I wanted to do with Balenciaga, not the other way around.\u201d Ghesquiere\u2019s collections are ineffably cool and cutting-edge, but they have also had a huge commercial impact; not so much in terms of what he sells himself (his is a rarefied, high-end designer product) but through his influence on other designers. At first, he was a complete unknown. In his first year there were blousons on linked circles, apron tunics and batwing tops. There were sheer high-necked dresses with flowing skirts. His first collection was Spring\/Summer 1998, a strong collection that returned to the roots of Balenciaga but whose showing very few people attended. Competing on the Paris catwalk schedule with the likes of John Galliano at Dior, Alexander McQueen at Givenchy, Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton and Stella McCartney at Chlo\u00e9, Ghesquiere's first collection failed to make a big splash. By 2000, with seven collections behind him, the picture was very different. During the autumn\/winter ready-to-wear collections in February 2001, when his show was heralded as \"totally original\" by Suzy Menkes, Ghesquiere's creations were in such high demand that Balenciaga in Paris was unable to meet the demands of the crowds that gathered daily at the flagship store. He's often called a designer's designer and compared to Yves Saint-Laurent in his ability to feel and shape fashion. In October 2000, he was named avant-garde designer of the year at the VHI\/Vogue Fashion Awards and a year later, he was named Womenswear Designer of the Year by the CFDA. Most recently Ghesquiere was featured in Time's 100 Most Influential People of 2005, the only fashion designer in this year's edition (with exception of Ralph Lauren and Sean Combs, who were not featured for their fashion). Ghesquiere was called \"fashion's most sought-after and influential figure\" (American Vogue), \"the most intriguing and original designer of his generation ... the hippest, hottest, most sought-after creator by fashion aficionados\", \"surely one of the few genuinely original voices in fashion today\" (Godfrey Deeny). He's also the man who prompted the normally tight-lipped Kate Moss to coo, \"I've got so much Balenciaga but it's never enough.\" and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny: \"I worship Balenciaga\". The house of Balenciaga designed the dresses worn by Jennifer Connelly and Nicole Kidman to the 2006 Academy Awards, as well as the wedding gown Kidman wore for her recent marriage to Keith Urban. Kylie Minogue has also wore a Balenciaga dress for her \"Slow\" music video and for her concert tour. His pencil-thin pants are particularly popular, many girls say he cuts the sexiest trousers for women. Ultimate proof of success, they're now widely copied everywhere, have become a fashion paradigm. \"His signature silhouette of skinny pants and blouson jacket, a vestige of Ghesquiere's obsession with the '80s (think Bow Wow Wow), is a virtual staple in fashion's contemporary market.\" (Time). Today, the brand is also famous for its line of motorcycle-inspired handbags, especially the famous \"Lariat\". For the present, Ghesquiere's plans are only to focus on building Balenciaga into an international powerhouse brand, developing perfumes, menswear and a full range of accessories. He often wears clothes by Maison Martin Margiela, another designer he deeply respects. Like Margiela, he likes to keep his private life private and, keen to avoid the label of fashion's new celebrity a title that cannot be held for long Ghesquiere insists that he has never wanted to be famous. But if he achieves his next goal, to eventually produce a label under his own name, something many of his numerous fahionistas fans are wanting him to do, he may have no choice. He says that he is saving his own name for something very new and very different.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["He's worn by such fashion icons and \"muses\" for some of them as Charlotte Gainsbourg","Gwyneth Paltrow","Sienna Miller","Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen","model-singer-actress Joana Preiss","Anna Wintour American Vogue's editor-in-chief","actress Isabelle Huppert","'60s icon in the Francophone world Fran\u00e7oise Hardy","model Irina Lazareanu","Amira Casar","classical pianist H\u00e9lene Grimaud","Chinese actress Maggie Cheung","and Marianne Faithfull."],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Balenciaga"]}

He was studying at Cambridge University and was designing the costumes for the dramatic performances. They got a good review and a journalist convinced him that his future lay in designing clothes. He left Cambridge without a degree and took a job with a London dressmaker called Madame Desiree. \n He was only there 3 months, but the experience convinced him that he had joined the right field. He briefly worked for Lucile and a house called Esther, and in 1923 started a salon under his own name. \n His early collections, comprised tailored day ensembles and elegant evening clothes. His ceremonial clothing propelled him to fame. His first wedding dress was described in the press as \"the 8th wonder of the world\" and wore by the bride of Lord Weymouth. \n   The turning point in his career came when he designed the brides and bridesmaids dresses for the wedding of the Duke of Gloucester, 3rd son of King George V. Two of the bridesmaids were Princess Elizabeth (later Queen) and Princess Margaret. In 1938 he was appointed dressmaker to the British Royal Family and designed gowns for overseas visits, especially for Queen Elizabeth (now the Queen Mother). The present Queen Elizabeth had her wedding gown and coronation gown (in 1953) made by Hartnell, as well as numerous of her other clothes, both casual and formal. The dress designed for the Queen's wedding contained 10,000 seed pearls and many thousands of white crystal beads. For its display in 2003 for the anniversary of the coronation of Her Majesty The Queen, 10 restorers worked on it. In the embroidery, various symbols for different countries of the Commonwealth can be seen, such as the Scottish thistle, Australian wattle, the maple leaf of Canada and the pearly lotus flower for India. In addition to his royal work, he designed for the theatre - for Noel Coward productions, Mistinguett and Marlene Dietrich. He was also a prolific designer of film costumes. From 1930 until 1963, Hartnell designed costumes for 21 films, including \"Suddenly Last Summer\" in 1960. During the war, he was responsible for the uniforms of the British Red Cross, the Women's Royal Army Corp and the Women's Police Force. During World War II he adhered to the regulations for economic use of fabric, lack of buttons, embroidery, etc., even for the Queen and hand painted some of her dresses himself. He was knighted Sir Norman Hartnell in 1977 (the first couturier to be so honoured). Sir Norman Hartnell died in June 1979 at the age of 78. Marc Bohan designed for the house of Hartnell from 1989 to 1992 and the designer Yuki also briefly worked under him in the late 60's.

He studied Applied Arts at the Philadelphia Museum College of Art and Fashion Design at the Mayer School of Fashion in New York, graduating 1965. \n He took the new name of Scott Barrie when he started his fashion career. \n   He was influenced by his godmother who had designed clothes for the jazz singers Dinah Washington and Sarah Vaughan. His mother did not initially encourage him because she felt a black man would not have a future in fashion designing, but Scott proved her wrong. His first job was with the Allen Cole boutique, New York from 1966 to 1969. From 1969 to 1982 he ran his own concern Barrie Sport in New York, in between introducing Barrie Plus Collections in 1974. He began making clothes at home on his cutting table and home sewing machine. First orders came from small boutiques, but when Henri Bendel and Bloomingdales ordered his sexy jersey dresses, he became more well-known and could move into a spacious workroom on 7th Avenue. Alongside his own label, Scott designed for S.E.L., made loungewear for Barad and furs for Barlan. In 1982, he moved to Milan, Italy and formed Scott Barrie Italy, in partnership with Kinshido Company of Japan. From 1983 to 1991 he was the designer for the Milan D'Or division of Kinshido. From 1986 to 1988 Barrie designed free-lance for Krizia, Milan. Scott Barrie was one of a group of vibrant black designers including Willi Smith, Stephen Burrows, Patrick Kelly, and Jon Haggins who established themselves on New York's 7th Avenue in the 1970's and 1980's. Their creative energy really stimulated the world of fashion. His forte was the sensuous use of jersey, cut in inventive and unexpected ways, making elegant and sexy evening wear. Many of the successful black models like Naomi Sims, loved his clothes. Scott also created costumes for films and the theatre, particularly for Jeffrey Ballet's production of \"Deuce Coupe\". He died quite young, in Alessandria, Italy, in June 1993 at the age of 47.","the_look":"The intermingling of culture and race on New York's Seventh Avenue in the 1960s brought a new sort of creative energy that challenged accepted standards. Barrie's models did not parade the catwalk with elegance; instead they boogied wildly and arrogantly, with a streetwise brashness. It was a testimony to the changing times that the clothes were accepted at the higher end of the ready-to-wear market.\nDescribing himself in the 1970s as being midway between the crazy extremes of Zandra Rhodes and Herbert Kasper, Barrie quickly established himself as a designer of sexy, often outrageous clothes. His eveningwear was particularly noteworthy: skinny gowns sprinkled with pailettes and dangerously high splits, or jersey slips that slid tantalizingly over the figure.\nHis innovative clothes included use of Acrilan, Celanese acetate knit, Jasco matte jersey and Lurex. He made emsembles of pull-on T-shirts with pants, wrap min dresses, d\u00e9collet\u00e9 shirt-tunic dresses laced down the front with cords or chains, long halter dresses, and elasticized pull-on strapless jumpsuits. \nBarrie's fort\u00e9 was the sensuous use of jersey, cut in inventive and unexpected ways, from which he created elegant and often risqu\u00e9 eveningwear.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

Her father James, was a professor of art and noted painter. She and her family would travel to California annually and make trips along that state's portion of the famed U.S. Route 66. These trips actually made Lepore feel like a gypsy, a feeling she still has about herself. \n Trips to California made Lepore enjoy traveling, and she moved from Ohio to New York City, where she began to develop her professional career as a designer. She attended New York's Fashion Institute of Technology and graduated with a degree in design. \n   However, Nanette knew she wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until her creations bore her own name.  In 1992, bolstered by a $5,000 loan from her dad to strike out on her own, Nanette set up shop in a penthouse office in the garment district.  It quickly became an incubator for poets and painters who would bounce ideas off one another while stargazing on the roof. Lepore gained celebrity in the fashion world after she returned to California, opening a boutique store in Los Angeles and selling her outfits to clients in Europe and Asia. She also began to have her items featured in the famous American store chain, Neiman Marcus. She also gained renown for her flair on the runway and began to attract stars. In spring 2007, Nanette Lepore decided to do a collection of shoes with Keds. Mischa Barton was the face of the line.

In the early 1970's she moved to London to begin her long and close association with Stephen Marks. First they worked together at French Connection, for whom Nicole was the principal designer for over a decade. Then in 1982, Marks launched the Nicole Farhi label, giving Nicole the opportunity to design a collection which more closely reflected the clothes she herself wanted to wear. \n   Five years into the life of the new company, Nicole launched a collection of sporty, easy pieces, a diffusion line under the name FARHI, recently re-launched as FARHI by Nicole Farhi. Since then, the Nicole Farhi brand has grown to include shoes, small leather goods, perfume and jewellery. When Nicole launched her now renowned menswear collection, it seemed an effortless transition. Softly tailored suits and separates have now made her menswear as coveted and popular as her women's. In September 1994 Farhi opened her flagship store on London's New Bond Street and underneath that, the first restaurant, Nicole's. Nicole's is contemporary and minimal in design and the modern European menu downstairs has an emphasis on fresh seasonal ingredients.

After spending a short period at military school during World War I, he studied fashion design at the Pratt Institute. \n In 1922, he joined the New York studio of Paramount Pictures where he designed clothes for Gloria Swanson and other stars of silent movies. He then worked as a costume designer on Broadway, making the costumes for the Ziegfeld Follies and the Cotton Club, as well as for the Brooks Costume Company and for wholesale dress manufacturer Charles Armour. In 1928, he was hired by Hattie Carnegie and remained with her until 1941. \n   In 1943 Norell won a Coty Fashion Award and became a critic at Pratt Institute fashion department, where he was previously a student. Shortly afterwards Anthony Traina invited him to form the fashion company Traina-Norrell, with Traina looking after the business side and Norell the fashion side. By 1944, Norell had launched chemise dresses, evening dresses, fur coats, sequined evening sheaths, fur slacks and empire-line dresses. From his early years with Hattie Carnegie, Norell learned all about meticulous cut, fit, and quality fabrics. Regular trips to Paris exposed him to the standards of couture that made French clothes the epitome of high fashion. Norell had the unique ability to translate the characteristics of couture into American ready-to-wear. Today, he is considered by many in the world of fashion to be one of the foremost fashion designers in US history, on a par with the legendary French couturiers.","the_look":"Simple, well-made clothes that would last and remain fashionable for many years became the hallmark of Norman Norell. He gained a reputation for flattering design while Traina, whose well-heeled client\u00e9le appreciated the snob appeal of pared-down day clothes and dramatic eveningwear. He did inspect each model garment individually, carefully, in the tradition of a couturier, and was just as demanding in proper fabrication and finish. \nGlittering paillettes, which were not rationed, would be splashed on evening skirts\u2014paired with sweater tops for comfort in unheated rooms\u2014or on coats. Later, the lavish use of all-out glamor sequins evolved into Norell's signature shimmering \"mermaid\" evening dresses, formfitting, round-necked and short-sleeved. The round neckline, plain instead of the then-popular draped, became one of the features of Norell's designs of which he was most proud. He used revealing bathing suit necklines for evening as well, with sable trim or jeweled buttons for contrast. Variations on these themes continued throughout the years, even after trousersuits became a regular part of Norell's repertoire.\nStriking in their simplicity, Norell suits would skim the body, making the wearer the focus of attention rather than the clothes. Daytime drama came from bold, clear colors such as red, black, beige, bright orange, or pale blue, punctuated by large, plain contrasting buttons. Stripes, dots, and checks were the only patterns, although Norell was credited with introducing leopard prints in the 1940s, again, years before they became widespread in use. Norell's faithful clients hailed his clothes as some of the most comfortable they had ever worn.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

Feeling that there was a gap in the market for statement shoes that were in the same league as the hats designed by Treacy, and the clothes being designed by Alexander McQueen and Hussein Chalayan, he enrolled at Cordwainers in 2001. He dropped out after one year - having learned \"footwear making\" - to continue his work full-time with Philip Treacy. In 2005, he made the catwalk shoes for Ghost and John Rocha to raise the money to produce his own collection. He produced his first eponymous collection for spring\/summer 2005, which earned him the Cond\u00e9 Nast Footwear News Vivan Infantino award in 2006 for emerging talent. In April 2005, he took his collection to New York to show to the fashion press. While there, the shoes came to the attention of Visionaire's Cecilia Dean, who loved them. She was intrinsic in aligning Kirkwood with Rodarte - for whom he has been creating show shoes since spring\/summer 2009. In July 2007, he won the AltaRoma\/Vogue Italia award for accessories design - as well as commendations from American Vogue's editor-at-large Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley and Vogue Italia's editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani - for his spring\/summer 2008 collection. In March 2008, he was appointed to the role of accessories designer at Pollini (which was relaunched in September 2008), alongside Jonathan Saunders as creative director. In December 2008, he was awarded the Footwear Designer of the Year award by Cond\u00e9 Nast's Footwear News publication. In November 2008, Kirkwood was the winner of the Swarovski Emerging Talent for Accessories prize at the British Fashion Awards. He opened his first standalone concession space at London's Dover Street Market in July 2009. In late 2009, Kirkwood collaborated with Swarovski to design the Nicholas Kirkwood for Atelier Swarovski jewellery collection. He was nominated for the inaugural BFC\/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund Award in 2010, but lost to Erdem. He has created a collection of co-designed and co-branded shoes with Erdem for autumn\/winter 2010-11.

{"designer_name":"Nin Castle","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/nin-castle\/"],"biography":"In 2001 while doing a Fashion and Business Studies degree at Brighton University she became interested in sustainable design. \n Nin found a kindred spirit in fellow student Phoebe Emerson, and they planned to design and make fashion garments with a difference. \n They made a deal with a local charity shop who let them go through all the bags of textiles being sent to the rag factory, and they paid the charity L1 a bag. The two friends moved into an old car showroom in Brighton. \n   Nin Caste and Phoebe Emerson started Goodone to design and produce high quality, unique clothing, made exclusively from locally sourced, recycled fabrics. In 2006 they had local boutiques as their first customers. When the business had been going for six months they went on a three-day course for start-ups run by the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship (NCGE) and the RSA. Inspired by what they'd learnt on the course they moved to London to be in the fashion hub, and found a studio in Hackney. Soon afterwards Goodone were awarded a L15,000 prize by the NCGE. In January 2008 Phoebe, who had managed the business side, left Goodone to work in other areas of social enterprise. Running the business as well as the design has been a steep learning curve for Nin, but she's expanded its scope. A project designing clothes for a charity in Cape Town has led to the workers manufacturing her fashion range. She's working with six charities, including Shelter and WWF, using old campaign t-shirts for new designs, and advises commercial companies on recycling faulty stock which usually gets burnt. All this is alongside producing a small rolling collection of clothes selling in boutiques in London and Manchester.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

His grandfather was Count Arthur Cassini who was Russian Czar Nicholas's ambassador to Washington during the McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt administrations. His mother was Countess Marguerite Cassini. His father was Count Alexander Loiewski. Oleg used his mother's name for his professional career. \n He was educated in Florence at the English Catholic School and graduated from the Accademia delle Belle Arti in 1932. \n   In 1933 he worked briefly for his mother's dress salon, and then opened his own salon in Rome the same year. In 1936, he went to New York and designed for various 7th Avenue stores until 1940 when he joined 20th century Fox in Hollywood. Cassini married actress Gene Tierney on July 11, 1941 and designed her costumes for 7 of her films. As Tierney\u2019s parents didn\u2019t approve of the union, the couple eloped to Las Vegas, and used earrings as wedding rings. The couple had two daughters, Antoinette Daria Cassini (born October 15, 1943) and Christine \u201cTina\u201d Cassini (born November 19, 1948). Tierney contracted German measles during her first pregnancy, and their daughter, Daria, was born deaf, blind and mentally retarded. Tierney had an affair with John F. Kennedy, and the couple were divorced on February 28, 1952, but he continued to design for occasional Hollywood films up till 1967. By 1950, he was back on 7th Avenue in New York and during the 50's, his name was associated with glamorous ready-to-wear sheath dresses, knitted suits, jackets and cocktail dresses. He also designed extensively for Broadway and television. Oleg was very much in love with Grace Kelly in 1953-54, and wanted to marry her. However she rejected him in favour of Prince Ranier of Monaco, whom she subsequently married. In the 1960\u2019s Cassini was chosen by Jacqueline Kennedy to design her state wardrobe. He worked closely with her in the evolution of her personal clothing style, creating many widely copied garments. He co-ordinated her wardrobe with hats, furs, gloves, shoes, and handbags. He made more than 100 dresses in the first year, and 300 during the course of the administration. His house continues till today making elegant clothes for beautiful women. Cassini himself is in his 90's and lives a life of leasure in Connecticut. Oleg was awarded a Special Tribute award from the CFDA in 2003. Oleg Cassini has heard the rumours before, but he won't let them go undisputed. Arnold Scaasi's new book \"Women I have dressed (and undressed)\" states that Oleg copied French designs when dressing Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy from 1960 to 1963 when she was America's First Lady.

He wanted to be a painter, and began sketching for leading Spanish fashion houses to pay for his art studies. In 1956, Mrs John Lodge, the wife of the US Ambassador to Spain, saw some of his drawings and commissioned him to make a dress for her daughter Beatrice. Soon after, Oscar came to the attention of Cristobal Balenciaga, the famous designer, who took him on at his Eisa atelier in Madrid. In 1961, he was hired as an assistant by Antonio del Castillo at the Lanvin-Castillo couture house in Paris. Following the same course as Castillo, de la Renta moved to New York in 1963 to design the custom-made collection at Elizabeth Arden. In 1965 De la Renta moved to Jane Derby and when she died in 1969, he took over the firm and gave it his own name. During the sixties, he developed a reputation as a designer of extravagant, opulent yet tasteful clothes. He created a variety of theme collections based on fashions of the belle \u00e9poque, abstract art prints, oriental inspired evening clothes and exotic flamenco dresses. His day clothes by comparison, were almost austere: little coats made lavish only by the fur trim. In 1967 his Gypsy collection attracted a great deal of attention. His clothes had become ornate and witty, such as bejewelled hot pants worn under a silk mini-dress and coats made of bandanna-printed denim In 1969 Djellabahs appeared, with scrolling Moroccan braid enhanced by pearls and gems. Oscar married Francoise de Langlade in 1967. She was the editor-in-chief of French Vogue. She died in 1983. He married for the second time to Annette Reed in 1989 and they have a son Moises. By the early seventies, his day clothes had become more casual. Although some of his soft chiffon evening dresses followed the current silhouette, he maintained his tradition of a close-fitting waist and a deep V-neckline. In 1993 de la Renta was hired by the House of Pierre Balmain to design their couture collection, becoming the first American designer since Mainbocher to design couture in Paris, France. He designed for Balmain for nearly a decade, presenting his last collection in 2001. In 1997 De la Renta launched his less-expensive line OSCAR designed for the working woman. In the year 2001, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Oscar de la Renta was one of those honoured. 19 year old Moises de la Renta, Oscar's son, is launching his own label, which will be a denim-based collection of womenswear, menswear and accessories. He will be asking his father for advice all the way, saying \"he is my mentor as a father and a designer.\" In July 2004, Oscar handed over the title of Chief Executive to his 36 year old son-in-law Alex Bolen, husband of Oscar's stepdaughter Eliza Reed Bolen. Alex has earlier worked with Donna Karan and Marc Jacobs. Oscar retains the title of Chairman, and will remain very active in all aspects of the business, not only design. the label Although Oscar continues to design all of the collections and remains Chairman, he handed over his previous title of Chief Executive to son-in-law Alex Bolen in 2004. In 1997 Oscar launched OSCAR by Oscar de la Renta, a high-end sports line for the working girl, and in fall 2004 he debuted O Oscar, a sportswear line for the masses, with all items retailing for less than $100. Although that line is currently on hiatus, the new brand president Maria Vaccaro is re-launching the line for spring 2006. It's this marked ability to straddle diverse markets and worlds that has ensured his continued success.","the_look":"Luxurious ruffles, embroidery, ostrich-feathered eveningwear, and ornate beading and embellishments like buttons and metallic threads.","who_wears_it":["Oscar's timeless pieces have no shortage of admirers.

{"designer_name":"Ozwald Boateng","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/ozwald-boateng\/"],"biography":"Tagged as one of London's freshest creative fashion forces, this Anglo-African began his career as a tailor but began showing his wares in runway collections in the mid-1990s. \n Boateng was born in 1968, in London, England. His parents were originally from Ghana, and came to London in 1950s. The family, which included Boateng's two older siblings, lived in the Muswell Hill area of north London, but his parents divorced when Boateng was eight. In Ghana his mother had worked in the fabric business, and took in custom work as a seamstress in England. Boateng recalled that as a five-year-old, his mother made him a purple mohair suit that quickly became his favorite outfit. His father, once headmaster of a school in Ghana, was a strict but not authoritarian parent. \n At the age of 16, Boateng began dating a girl he met at a London technical college, where he was studying computer science at the time. She showed him how to make clothes and Boateng soon began making clothes for himself. \n   Soon Boateng had switched his major to fashion design at Southgate College, and he began working out of a studio in London's East End and selling his wares. He found the program at Southgate difficult at times. By the time he was 18, Boateng's clothes were selling at stores in the King's Road section of Chelsea, and in 1993 he opened a store on another trendy street, Portobello Road. He found his true calling, however, when he began haunting the austere but pricey tailor shops of London's Savile Row, where British kings and prime ministers, international heads of state, and wealthy men with impeccable taste in clothes had been having suits custom-made for generations. Switching the focus of his business to making custom, or bespoke suits for men, Boateng attracted notice when he became one of the first-ever British tailors to stage a fashion show. Referring to the 1994 London show, but the publicity helped him find a backer for a ready-to-wear line and to open a more formal retail venture, a store just off the famed Savile Row, on Vigo Street, in 1995. Soon his ready-to-wear line was selling at Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys New York in the United States. Between 1996 and 1997, Boateng's sales soared 150 percent worldwide, and he was even invited to dine at No. 10 Downing Street, the residence of Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair. In early 1998, however, a looming financial crisis in Asia caused two large orders from Hong Kong and Japan to be cancelled, and Boateng lost his backer. His ready-to-wear business went into receivership in the spring of 1998, but he saved it by entering into a deal with a British department store chain, Debenham's, to design a moderately priced line of men's clothing. In 1999 Boateng suffered another setback when his entire collection was stolen, and in 2001 found himself in an unusual battle with Sean \"P.Diddy\" Combs over scheduling concerns at the New York spring menswear collection shows. Boateng's Bryant Park event was scheduled for 7 p.m., while Combs's \"Sean Jean\" line was going to be shown at 8 p.m. Combs's representatives, however, overwhelmed by the media attention surrounding the rap mogul, asked that all invitees be seated by 7 p.m.--which meant that many important buyers and tastemakers would miss Boateng's collection. Representatives from both sides met, and peace was made. Despite such flamboyant wares, Boateng remained an accepted presence among the more staid Savile Row tailors. When his store opened, many brought him welcome gifts.","the_look":"British menswear designer Ozwald Boateng has been called \"the peacock of Savile Row\" for the exuberant fabric colors he uses in his ready-to-wear collections and line of custom suits.","who_wears_it":["Smashing Pumpkins","Mick Jagger","Seal","Herbie Hancock","and Robbie Williams"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ozwald_boateng","brands":["Givenchy"]}

{"designer_name":"Olga Berluti","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/olga-berluti\/"],"biography":"Olga joined her cousin Talbinio in Paris in 1959. Learning the craft of a shoemaker, she was not allowed to draw the pitched thread, which was considered as a man\u2019s job. So she took interest in the other aspects of the craft: the leather, the foot, the customers. \n 1968 was the year for new ideas. Olga created dream lasts and colours. From 1970 onwards, Olga worked in contact with the greatest designers (Warhol, Truffaut, Yves Saint-Laurent) on the concept that inspired her most: leather as a continuation of the human skin. Customers, whom she loves so much, have always been participating actors in her creations. \n Olga first imagined a recipe for patinas with unique transparencies when she discovered the discolouring virtues of the moon. \n   In 1980 she invented Venezia leather. This natural skin with great suppleness allows to obtain colours with unique depth thanks to a special tanning process. She then applied a patina to the leather that exalted the colour and made it transparent. Gorged with essential oils, it is as deep and warm as Japanese lacquer. Through this artisanal work, Berluti continues to cultivate exclusivity, giving each shoe and each bag a unique colour. Located in the very heart of Paris, in the fashionable district of Le Marais, Olga\u2019s workshop is the place where creation happens. When she is not working, she welcomes improvised dinners and sometimes a client stops by for the night. Her friends and customers took part directly or indirectly to the decoration. Armchairs were created by Carlo Rampazzi, the interior designer of Berluti boutiques, paintings were made by Sunao Tanaka, who also drew the last Berluti campaign. As an homage for her clients she engraved some of their letters on the leather of her trunks. In the middle of essential oils, kept in L\u2019Heure Bleue de Guerlain perfume bottles (her mother\u2019s perfume), the made to measure workbench occupies the place of honour. On it, the creations become alive. Just like Olga, the workshop is not only the one of a shoemaker but also of a real artist. Olga, besides being an outstanding female bootmaker, is a renowned costume designer, who was rewarded for several movies. An invisible thread connects Berluti clients. It comes from their shared passion for the shoe. Together and facing it, they scrutinise, guess, imagine and dream. Why not prolong the moment? This is why the Club evenings were born. The Club is named Swann after the Proustian hero and all he represents; elegance, romance and distance from the ordinary world. Like him, Berluti clients share a luxury, not that of appearing but that of being. This may be manifested by objects that have accompanied them for many years and that they cherish, bear their imprint and that time has fashioned in their image. Clients in the Swann Club share a style, the art of being. The first meeting was held at the Hotel Crillon in 1992. First and foremost, they are happy to meet again and dine together. First they discuss the subject, the shoe\u2019s aesthetic, from the standpoint of pure reason. They often have new ideas or discoveries to share with the House of Berluti. Then the real work begins. The patina session is extremely codified. It is a true ritual, with time honoured gestures; the table cloth is removed, polishes are presented, squares of noble Venetian linen are wrapped around fingers; the men take off their shoes and place them on the table. Together, coached by Olga, they begin to massage the leather. Then they begin to buff. Some, traditional, use water; others, more rarely (but history bears witness thereto) use a dab of champagne. The main rule is that there are no rules except one; like Proust\u2019s salon no \u201cbores\u201d are allowed.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Berluti"]}

{"designer_name":"Ossie Clark","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/ossie-clark\/"],"biography":"Raymond Clark was born in 1942 into a working class family of 8 in Liverpool, in the North of England, and was nicknamed Ossie after Oswaldtwistle, the name of the town he was evacuated to during World War II. Ossie's mother, Anne Grace Clark, was in labor with Ossie for seven days during an air raid in World War II. Anne had been expecting a girl and so had no name picked out for her new baby. She let the midwife name him Raymond. Ossie was the youngest of six children ( Gladys, Kay, Beryl, Sammy and John ). Ossie and his brother John sang in the church choir at St Oswald's church in Winwick where Ossie won awards for his vocal talents. \n Family and friends noted that from a very early age he was \"brilliant at doing anything\". Young Ossie would make clothes for his nieces and nephews. He practiced tailoring clothing on his dolls and designed swimsuits for the neighborhood girls when not yet ten years old. The Art teacher at Ossie's Secondary School recognised Ossie's creative flair and gave him a large collection of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar magazines. Clark pored over these magazines and took in all the glamour and cutting edge fashion. \n At the age of thirteen Ossie studied architecture in school. He later said that the experience was\"invaluable\" The class taught him the fundamentals of proportion, height and volume. He would later go on to use all of these to great effect in his fashion designs. \n   Soon after leaving Beamont Secondary Technical School, Clark attended the Regional College Of Art in Manchester, now Manchester Metropolitan University at age sixteen in 1957. Ossie had to get up very early in the morning to make the long trip from home to college each day. Anne Clark would give Ossie prescribed pills to keep him awake and alert. This would be the start of a life-long addiction to both prescribed and illegal drugs. From 1961 to 1964 he attended the Royal College of Art in London. Here he studied under the legendary Professor Janey Ironside (who numbered Zandra Rhodes, Bill Gibb and Antony Price among her prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.) For his sensational degree show, Clark sent out one model in a coat with lightbulbs around the collar. Other garments were made from an op-art patterned black-and-white twill fabric he found in the USA. While studying in Manchester, he met and made a life-long friend of artist David Hockney. In 1970 Hockney painted the famous picture of Ossie, Celia and their white cat Percy. Ossie also met textile designer Celia Birtwell at college. Birtwell's charming prints would become the perfect match to Ossie Clark's sleek designs. While at the RCA, he quickly began to make his mark in the fashion industry, with Alice Pollock's exclusive boutique Quorum featuring his designs in 1966. Ossie had met Pollock at a party on the King's Road and so taken with the young designer was she that she immediately ordered a whole collection of dresses for her boutique. Ossie presented a collection of white and cream chiffon garments that sold fast. Pollock wanted Clark's clothes to have a more organic feel and so commissioned Celia Birtwell to produce special textiles for the next collection. In this way, one of fashions most famous collaborations was born: with Ossie Clark designing clothes and Celia Birtwell desiging prints. Clark joined it full-time in 1966. Ossie established himself as the star of London's fashion scene. Ossie was noted from this period on to buy six new record albums a week of all the newest and most popular recording artists. His record collection was love of music and art were famous amongst Ossie's friends. Also at this time, Ossie began to take hard drugs more recreationally with friend and business partner Alice Pollok. The first full Ossie Clark collection was bought by the Henri Bendel department store in New York. This was the first export of a talent young British designers work. His simple, elegant dresses were widely copied by the designers on Seventh Avenue. The period from 1965 to 1974 is regarded as his zenith, during which time he had many famous clients. While Ossie and Alice were great at creating an image and drawing in the rich and famous they were less successful at managing a business. Many garments were given away to celebrities or just disappeared from the shop. By 1967 Quorum, the partnership between Alice Pollock and Ossie, was deeply in debt and Ossie and Alice agreed to sell Quorum to a large UK fashion house, Radley (run by Alfred Radley). Radley took over Quorum's debts and put the management onto a sound basis. Alfred Radley was keen to maintain what made Ossie special and so he continued to support Ossie's aspirations by developing the Ossie Clark brand and funding large annual fashion shows, expanding Quorum's retail business and distributing Ossie's dresses to leading retailers around the world. In 1967 Clark presented a fashion show at Chelsea Town Hall for Path\u00e9 News. He also showed his first full collection in London's Berkeley Square. Clark's was the first ready-to-wear collection ever to present a show during London fashion week. It was also the first British fashion show to feature black models. In 1968 Clark designed his first of many diffusion lines for Radley that made his clothes available to a high street clientele. Ossie enjoyed his relationship with Alfred Radley as he was strongly supported in his passion for designing and making special garments as well as being able to address a much larger popular market. The strong relationship between Ossie and Alfred Radley lasted until Ossie's death. In 1969, he married Celia Birtwell. Although Ossie was openly bisexual and carried on many affairs with men, he and Birtwell had two sons Albert and George, together. Clark had long hoped for a large family of his own and his children were a great joy in his life. In 1972 Manolo Blahnik launched his shoe-making career by making shoes for Clark's show. Clark made large-collared leather motocycle jackets, cut very short and zipped on one side at the front, which became a widely copied garment. He also made hot pants, maxi coats, and gypsy dresses with handkerchief points. He used metallic leather and snakeskin as fabrics, but his skill is mainly associated with the use of crepe, satin, jersey and chiffon. These fabrics he ruched and droaped into dresses and blouses with plunging necklines, tiny waists and full sleeves. Yves St. Laurent came to Ossie's shop in the Kings road, London, and shortly thereafter brought out his own collection of leather bomber jackets and culottes. However Ossie Clark had zero business sense, and his firm folded in 1981 owing large amounts of money. Clark freely adopted the hedonistic lifestyle of the 1960s and 1970s: his drug use greatly impacted on his emotional state and finances. Despite earning large amounts on royalties from the diffusion ranges manufactured by Radley his lifestyle and excesses meant that he failed to produce designs or any new work. Downfall soon followed, including personal bankruptcy in 1983. Clark and Birtwell divorced in the 1970s. This started a slow downward spiral for Ossie, who never recovered emotionally from the separation from Birtwell and his two children. With his family structure and work stability now gone, his creative output became strained. Going into the 1980s, fashion \u2014 British fashion in particular \u2014 turned towards the new punk rock craze. Clothing from Vivienne Westwood's shop on the King's Road became the most popular look. Ossie Clark's romantic flowing gowns were no longer in fashion. His fortunes declined and Clark went bankrupt and largely stopped working. In this time period, Clark became a devout Buddhist. Although technically out of business, Ossie would design freelance and do one-off dresses for friends and loyal fans. He also trained the designer Bella Freud to pattern-cut in the early 1990s. In 1984 Radley coaxed Ossie back to work for two seasons and he produced some beautiful garments but failed to discipline himself and again declined into the turmoil of drugs and despair; these were his last collections. Alfred Radley kept in regular contact with Clark throughout these final difficult and unproductive years. Radley strongly believed that Ossie was the greatest designer of his time and tried on many occasions to encourage him back to the design room: they last met for dinner just two weeks before his untimely death - during that meal they agreed to try to launch a new Ossie Clark range - it was not to be. He gave pattern-cutting lessons to the London designer Bella Freud, who said \"he just sped on, he could cut straight into the fabric without a paper pattern, it was amazing.\" Clark worked with Freud's technical staff for a seaon. In October 1996, at the age of 54, he was murdered by his lover Diego Cogolato. His talent was a great loss to the fashion world.","the_look":"He designed both daywear and eveningwear, often using sensuous fabrics such as satin, chiffon, crepe, and clinging jersey. Although, since he was so versatile and prolific, it is hard to characterize his style, he was probably best known for clinging crepe and jersey dresses with plunging necklines, figure-hugging waists, and swirling skirts, but he was equally capable of producing close-fitting crisp linen suits. Innovations in terms of cut included suits with elbow-length tight-fitting sleeves over full long-sleeved blouses. In the late 1960s, he used exotic materials such as snakeskin, feathers, and metallic prints.","who_wears_it":["Mich Jagger","the Beatles","Marianne Faithfull","Liza Minnelli","Bianca Jagger","Kate Moss","Naomi Campbell","Sharon Tate","Britt Ekland","Marianne Faithfull","Anita Pallenberg","Twiggy","Marie Helvin","Cathy McGowan","and Goldie Hawn."],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Oskar Metsavaht","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/oskar-metsavaht\/"],"biography":"In 1986 the young sportsman Oskar Metsavaht created a coat he could wear on an expedition to Mount Aconcgua, in the Andes, and the piece not only protected him from the cold but was also greatly admired by his mountaineering and skiing friends. Encouraged by the success of his creation, Oskar Metsavah decided to launch the Osklen label, specializing in sports jackets with a clean and funky style. \n Within two years time, Oskar Metsavaht had designed a whole collection of sportswear. The first store was opened at the resort town of B\u00fazios, in Rio de Janeiro state, in 1989. \n In 1991, Metsavah combined surfing and snowboarding, his two great passions, in a new line geared towards adventurous sports. The concept worked out well and Osklen had its first fashion show in the Golden Room of the Copacabana Palace Hotel. \n   A leader in sportswear, Osklen has now created a line of womenswear, and has two shops in Rio de Janeiro. In 2002, in partnership with a team of biologists, he launched the environmental group e-brigade, the origin of a whole collection designed with recycled materials. Currently, Osklen has 26 stores in 9 Brazilian cities. Its products include sportswear, accessories, shoes and a more fashionable collection for men and women.","the_look":"Osklen's style is a perfect portrait of its creator.

The collection was just what you would have expected from the brand: a parade of solids in off-white and black, with a splash of green and brown in between, and a fantastic floral print interpreted in different fabrications here and there. The play on volumes was also characteristic, with samurai pants and oversized hand-knitted sweaters paired with long johns and tailored jackets.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/oskarmetsavaht","brands":["Osklen"]}

{"designer_name":"Omo Norma Kamali","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/omo-norma-kamali\/"],"biography":"Omo Norma Kamali was born in New York City in 1945. \n Norma Kamali is a New York-based fashion designer born in 1945. Kamali is credited with inventing many popular designs including the sleeping bag coat, a collection of styles created from actual silk parachutes, high heeled sneakers, and the popular packable, multi-use poly jersey clothing that can be worn in up to thirty variations per design. She also popularized the use of cotton jerseys in daywear in the 1980s. \n As a child, Norma Kamali wanted to be a painter, but her mother was firmly against the idea. She wanted her daughter to go into a more traditional profession. Undaunted, Norma studied fashion illustration at Fashion Institute of Technology in her native New York City and got her BFA degree in 1964. After graduation, Kamali realized that the opportunities for work in fashion illustration were few and far between, so she instead took a job for an international airline. This new job allowed Kamali to get discount airline tickets. She took the opportunity to fly to London every weekend from 1965-1967 to experience the famous swinging London lifestyle. It was in London that Kamali first saw wild mod fashions and extreme hairstyles from Europe. She started to wear short skirts and go-go boots, false eyelashes and mod wigs. She even went so far as to shave off her eyebrows to better draw them on in a more fashionable style. \n   Kamali quickly got the idea to take all the great European fashions she had seen back to New York and open a small shop. Her first store opened in 1968 at 229 East 53rd St., between 2nd and 3rd Avenues. It was a crowded basement shop that sold clothes from popular British designers and theSalvation Army. Things moved quickly after that. A feature article about the shop in Harper's Bazaar magazine spurred on Kamali's popularity with the fashion elite in New York. Magazine editors made Kamali's boutique a must-stop shopping experince. At about this time, Norma Kamali decided to start her own clothing line. Even though she had no prior experience in pattern drafting or sewing, she set to work making a collection. The popularity of her label forced her to expand her store. In 1974 Kamali moved her store to Madison Avenue in uptown New York City. At this time Kamali also designed the now famous \"parachute\" collection. Using real silk parachutes bought from the army surplus store, Kamali fashioned a punk-infused line that featured excessive volume controlled by drawstrings. In 1975 Norma came up with her most famous design, the \"sleeping bag\" coat. While on a camping trip she realized how comfortable it was to wrap a huge sleeping bag around her at all times. She quickly got to work making a large quilted jacket of a similar design to her sleeping bag and the outcome was a fashionable success. Kamali's swimwear has influenced an entire industry each season since her first collection in 1974. After Christie Brinkley appeared on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine in 1977 in a custom-made Norma Kamali \"pull bikini\", the public demand for the swimsuit was so much that Kamali's swimwear collections became among the most popular in the industry. Many of her swimsuit designs remain as popular as they were when they were originally introduced. Kamali was invited to design the costumes for the citizens of the Emerald City in the 1978 film version of the musical The Wiz. That same year Kamali divorced her husband, opened a new store at 6 West 56th Street in New York City, and started her OMO (standing for On My Own) line of clothing. Around this time Kamali created her famous sweat suit collection and her high-heeled sneakers, both of which have been often copied. In the early and mid-1980s Norma Kamali began to be recognized more and more for her effect on modern fashion and her consistent support of education and the arts. Diana Vreeland added Kamali's parachute clothing to the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In 1981 Kamali was awarded the Coty award for 'Design Innovation', and in 1982 she won the Coty for 'Best Womenswear Designer'. The following year the Coty committee decided to elect Norma Kamali into the Coty Hall of Fame for outstanding achievement in women's fashion. In 1984 theFIDM fashion college in Los Angeles, California gave their annual achievement award to Kamali. Kamali has received numerous awards for fashion design, architectural design, interior design, the creation of fashion video short stories, and community service. She also was one of the first to receive a plaque on New York's 7th Avenue Fashion Walk of Fame. Kamali began to sell her designs in Asia in 1982 and in Europe in 1987. Norma Kamali continued to innovate through the 1980s. She launched fragrance lines for both women and men. She designed costumes for many of Twyla Tharp's dance performances and launched a line of furniture and home furnishings, followed by an eyewear collection in 1992 and a cosmeticsline in 1994. Her fashions of this period took inspiration from gym clothing, Victorian garments and wild African designs (the famous \"Mudd Print\"). More recently, Kamali launched her \"Wellness Collection\" in 2003, comprising personal care, gourmet, and wellness products for all ages. She renovated her corporate headquarters at 11 West 56th Street in New York City to fit her wellness products. For more than 2 decades, Norma Kamali has dedicated time in the New York City public schools, teaching students how to bring art together with commerce and establish job opportunities for students who are artistic and creative. In Spring 2006, Norma Kamali and Everlast presented a contemporary sportswear collection. Kamali is well known for her reworked sweat suits from the 1980s and her collection with Everlast will carry this concept forward throughout the seasons. In 2006, Norma received a special tribute award from the Board of Directors of the CFDA. She continues to innovate in the fashion industry, from her newly re-energized swimwear collection to her successful online shop, launched in 1996. Kamali developed the \"Shop like a Celebrity\" service, to allow all her customers buying via the internet to receive clothes on approval and have 48 hours in which to try them on at home and keep and pay for only those they like. A New York nightlife fact : Norma Kamali was Ian Schrager's girlfriend during the Studio 54 days and also designed costumes for performers.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Lady Gaga","Madonna","Gwen Stefani","Beyonce","Whitney Houston","Rihanna","Katy Perry","Shakira","Britney Spears","Fergie","Mariah Carey","Halle Berry","Farrah Fawcett","Cameron Diaz","Jennifer Lopez","Katherine Heigl","Carly Simon","Demi Moore","Oprah","Kate Hudson","Tyra Banks","Julia Roberts","Isabella Rossellini","Scarlet Johansson","Sarah J.

His family owned a wholesale drapery business. His mother Fracoise, worked at a boutique managed by her two sisters. Balmain's father died when he was only 7 years old and his happiest childhood memories were of playing in the shop where his mother and aunts made dresses. He played with the fabrics and set his heart on becoming a couturier. \n Balmain studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, but did not complete his studies. He spent his spare time designing dresses and took some of them to show Robert Piguet, who bought three. He went to Molyneux who promised to give him a trial and when he was accepted, he left his architectural studies. From 1934 to 1939, he worked for Molyneux. \n   In 1936 he was called up for compulsory military service. When he had completed this in 1939, he joined Lucien Lelong and worked there during the German occupation of Paris. In 1945 he opened his own house, showing long bell-shaped skirts with small waists - a line which later became popular as Dior's New Look. In 1951 he opened branches in the USA selling ready-to-wear clothes. His success in the USA has been attributed to the fact that he was able to translate French fashion into clothes for the American woman's generally larger frame, without compromising style. Balmain designed many sportswear collections for this ready-to-wear market. His talent as a designer lay in his ability to make simple, tailored suits as well as grand evening gowns, in the same slender, supple and elegant lines. During the 50's he popularized the stole for day as well as evening wear and created a vogue for sheath dresses beneath jackets. His coats were generously cut to give a full back and we sometimes half belted. In the same period, his cossack like wraps and capes were trend-setters. Balmain was noted as a designer for the international set. In addition to his couture work, Pierre Balmain's designs were greatly in demand in Hollywood.Between 1951 and 1972, he designed costumes for 16 films, starring such stars as Vivien Leigh and Mae West. His elegance was also in demand for the off-screen clothes of Hollywood stars. He also designed for French films, including the famous film \"God Created Woman\" which introduced Brigitte Bardot to the world. Several designers worked under Pierre Balmain, who have gone on to become famous in their own names, including Gerard Pipart from 1948, Jean-Baptiste Caumont briefly, John Cavanagh from 1947 to 1951 and Karl Lagerfeld from 1955 to 1958. In 1964 Pierre Balmain wrote his autobiography, entitled \"My Years and Seasons\". He died in Paris in 1982. the label With the disappearance of Pierre Balmain in 1982, the torch was passed to Erik Mortensen - his personal assistant since 1951 and his closest colaborator - who maintained the House's traditions while developing and updating styles and designs in the spirit of its founder. In recognition of this achievement, Mortensen won ten France Haute Couture Golden Thimble Awards for his Automn-Winter 1983\/1984 collection. Erik Mortensen then went onto his second French Haute Couture Golden Thimble Award, presented at the Palais Galliera on 31 July 1987, for his Autumn-Winter 1987\/1988 collection. When Erik Mortensen left the House of Balmain in July 1990, he was replaced by youthful Herve-Pierre, who served as designer from 1990 through 1993 for both the Haute Couture and ready-to-wear collections. In 1993, Oscar de la Renta took over the couture design for Balmain. He presented collections for Balmain for nearly 10 years, which were very successful. Oscar presented his last collection for Balmain in July 2002. On the left is a gown from that Fall\/Winter 2002 collection. In December 2001 Swiss-born Laurent Mercier (born 1966) took over Balmain ready-to-wear. Mercier is a witty and talented designer, whose own signature collection won critical acclaim. In November 2002, he was also appointed Artistic Director of Balmain Haute Couture division also. A surprise announcement in June 2003 from Balmain, said that Laurent Mercier will no longer be their designer. They would not be showing their couture collection in July as expected.

He prefers geometric shapes and motifs, often ignoring the female form. He advanced into unisex fashions, sometimes experimental, not always practical. He introduced the \"bubble dress\" in 1954. Most of Cardin's early designs were day suits and coats with raglan sleeves, dresses that foreshadowed the sack line with their front-defined waistlines and Watteau backs. Some suits and dresses had tulip-shaped skirts and boxy waists, brushing jackets with rolled or scarf-tied collars. He also designed coats with draped hemlines, bubble skirts and unstructured chemises. Cardin had perfected immaculate, sleek tailoring and allowed his febrile admiration to catch fire. His clothes had the trappings of science-fiction and space travel. The world gasped at his space age 3-D shift, his astronaut men's look and his \"white breasts\" dress. He made dresses out of vinyl, hammered metal rings, broaches of carpenters nails, and diamonds. The clothes shrunk in size as the patterns grew. Knitted catsuits, tight leather trousers, close-fitting helmets and batwing jumpsuits were all in his collections.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["1965 Pierre Cardin (W)","1965 Blue Marine","1965 Singulier (W)","1972 Cardin pour elle","1972 Cardin pour monsieur","1972 Cardin men's cologne","1976 Cardin (W)","1981 Choc de Cardin (W)","1983 Paradoxe (W)","1985 Maxims de Paris","1986 Blue Marine de Cardin","1986 Man's Musk","1990 Rose (W)","1990 Choc Eau Tonique (W)","1992 Enigme (W)","1995 Ophelie (W)","1995 Insatiable","1997 Centaure Ambre Cuir (M)","1997 Centaure Cuir Blanc (M)","1997 Centaure Cuir Casaque (M)","1997 Centaure Cuir Etalon (M)","1997 Centaure Cuir Fougure (M)","2000 Tristan (M)","2001 Bleu Marine pour Elle (W)","(launch dates unknown)","Pierre Cardin Sportif","Pierre Cardin Yseult","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Pierre Cardin"]}
{"designer_name":"Paco Rabanne","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/paco-rabanne\/"],"biography":"  Paco Rabanne, originally Francisco Rabanedacuervo, was born on 18 February 1934 in Saint Sebastian, Spain. He was called Paco for short. His mother was Chief Seamstress at the Spanish salon of Balenciaga. \n He fled Spain for France with his mother when the Spanish Civil War broke out. He originally had an architect\u2019s education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris graduating in 1964, but became known as the \u201cenfant terrible\u201d of French fashion world in the 1960s. \n   Rabanne started his career in fashion by creating jewellery for Givenchy, Dior and Balenciaga. In 1965 he started his career as a designer by presenting a collection of 12 contemporary dresses which he called \"the Unwearables\". These included his first plastic dress. In 1966 Paco Rabanne opened his own outlet at the age of 32, where he earned international repute for his metal-linked plastic-disc dresses, sun goggles and jewellery made of plastic in primary colours. Paco Rabanne's dresses made of small plastic tiles linked together by chains, stole the show in Paris. In the 60's Paco Rabanne was in demand as a costume designer for the cinema, theatre and ballet. In the seventies, Paco Rabanne was the first to use black girls as models, which was thought to be quite outrageous then. One of his most famous outfits is the costume for Jane Fonda in the science-fiction film \"Barbarella\" in 1968. By 1975 he was still bending hard-edged materials into dresses, but very few people wore them. Women had discovered the appeal of softer, ethnic looks. In 1989 Paco Rabanne was awarded the Golden Thimble at the lst International Festival of Fashion. Collections during the 80's were constructed out of crinkled paper, strips of aluminium, rough cotton towelling, Perspex, maze-like configurations of patchwork leather, ostrich feathers and upholstery tassels. In 1990 Rabanne inaugurated his new boutique on the rue de Cherche Midi, Paris. The architect Eric Raffy designed the interiors based on 3 themes, metal, glass and light. During the 90's Paco Rabanne has diversified away from metallic and plastic materials only, and started to present collections in softer man-made fabrics like sofrina and amaretta. Paco has written a book called \"Journey\" which is a personal account of his search for spiritual understanding and tells how he has applied the results of his search to his creative fashion work. the label In 1999, Paco Rabanne presented his final collection and retired. Aurelien Tremblay and Christophe Decamin will design ready-to-wear for the house of Rabanne and Oliver Debias will design the Paco line. The Barcelona, Spain, financial house of Puig has bought out the house of Paco Rabanne in 2000. A major retrospective exhibition of the design work of Paco Rabanne has been mounted at the Galleria Carla Sozzani in Milan, from September to November 2002. In 2000 young designer Rosemary Rodriguez (born 1966) joined the House of Rabanne. In 2002, Paco Rabanne handed over the design to her. In February 2005, it was announced that Patrick Robinson, who was earlier with Perry Ellis, has joined the house of Paco Rabanne succeeding Rosemary Rodriguez who was the designer for several years there.","the_look":"His architectural background led him to use disks cut from metal or plastic, linked with wire and other interesting techniques when he created his fashions. \nIn his hi-tech period, he produced tiny metal, vinyl and plastic link dresses. These fashion experiments were important in pushing the boundaries of acceptable clothing to wear on the street. \nRabanne created his clothing by laying a woman on a table and shaping the metal parts directly on her body. This prompted Coco Chanel to remark that he was not so much a couturier but a metalworker.","who_wears_it":["Elizabeth Taylor","Audrey Hepburn","Brigette Bardot and Francoise Hardy"],"perfumes":["1968 Paco","1969 Calandre (W)","1969 Eau de Calandre (W)","1969 Eau de Calandre (M)","1973 Paco Rabanne pour homme","1975 La Nuit (W)","1976 La Nuit (M)","1979 Metal (M)","1984 S pour Homme","1984 Soin pour Homme","1985 Sport de Paco Rabanne","1986 Eau de Metal (M)","1986 Eau de Sport (M)","1988 Tenere (M)","1993 XS for women","1994 XS for men","1995 Excess (W)","1996 Chrome (M)","1997 Paco Rabanne eau de toilette","1998 Energy (M)","1999 Ultra Violet (W)","2000 Ultra Violet Intense (W)","2000 XS Extreme (W)","2001 XS Extreme (M)","2001 Ultra Violet Metal (W)","2001 Ultra Violet (M)","2001 Ultra Violet Metal Beach (W)","2001 XS Extreme Girl (W)","2002 Ultraviolet Aquatic (M)","2002 Ultraviolet Plastic (W)","2002 Paco Eau Pour Homme (M)","2003 Ultravoilet Liquid Crystal (W)","2003 Ultravoilet Liquid Crystal (M)","2003 Paco Rabanne Pour Elle (W)","2004 Ultraviolet Liquid Metal (W)","2005 Ultraviolet Liquid Metal Summer (M)","2006 XS Black (M)","Show Full"],"social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/pacorabanne","brands":["Paco Rabanne"]}

At the age of 16, with no career plans or qualifications, Paul Smith was propelled by his father into a menial job at the local clothing warehouse in his native Nottingham. \n However his real passion was sport and his ambition was to become a professional racing cyclist, until aged 17 years when cycling-mad Paul was in a terrible accident. Six months in hospital followed and during this time Paul made some new friends. After leaving hospital he arranged to meet them again and by chance the meeting place was a local pub that was popular with the students from the local art college. They talked of Mondrian, Warhol, Kokoshka, David Bailey and listened to the Rolling Stones, Miles Davis and much more. It was then Paul knew he wanted to be a part of this colourful world of ideas and excitement. \n   Within two years, Paul Smith was managing his first boutique in Nottingham and with the encouragement of his girlfriend Pauline Denyer (now wife) and a small amount of savings, opened a tiny shop in 1970. He started selling designer clothes, as well as garments he had made himself. He and his partner Pauline Denyer, would buy something from boutiques in London to stock up the Nottingham shop. She gave him the confidence to start his own business and encouraged him. By 1976 Paul showed his first menswear collection in Paris under the Paul Smith label. Within 20 years of his introduction to fashion Paul Smith had established himself as the pre-eminent British designer. Paul Smith has the ability to anticipate, and even spark off trends not only fashion but in the wider context of popular culture. He is best known for his signature shirts in offbeat colours and patterns. His label is successful worldwide, especially in Japan where he has more than 100 shops. In 1994, he opened a new line called \u201cWomen\u201d which has become very successful. In Japan, he gets mobbed like a rock star. He is the largest European menswear designer in Japan. In 2002 Paul Smith collaborated with Cappellini to create the Mondo collection of furniture inspired by observation and travel. In 2003 Paul designed an upholstery textile in partnership with Maharam, called \u2018Bespoke\u2019, which was inspired by classic pinstripe suiting. Even today, his numerous boutiques sell everything from toys to ties. It is this inspired eccentricity and a mind fine-tuned for marketing that has turned Smith's label into a status one. the label There are 12 different collections; Paul Smith, Paul Smith Women, PS by Paul Smith, Paul Smith Jeans, Paul Smith London, R.Newbold (Japan only), Paul Smith Accessories, Paul Smith Shoes, Paul Smith Fragrance, Paul Smith Watches, Paul Smith Pens and Paul Smith furniture and \u2018things\u2019. Paul Smith rugs, china, spectacles and fragrance are made under license. Designed in Nottingham and London, the Paul Smith collections are primarily produced in England and Italy while the fabrics used are mainly of Italian, French and British origin. Paul Smith is global - the collection is wholesaled to thirty five countries and has fourteen shops in England. Paul Smith shops are found in London, Nottingham, Paris, Milan, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines, Korea, Kuwait, U.A.E. \u2013 and over two hundred throughout Japan. Paul remains fully involved in the Japanese business; designing the clothes, choosing the fabrics, approving the shop locations and overseeing every development within the company. Paul Smith also has impressive and diverse showrooms in London, Paris, Milan, New York and Tokyo. Paul Smith continues to be an integral part of the company; he is both designer and chairman.

She studied political science at New York University. Her career in fashion started when she got married to her husband Andy, because she designed her own wedding dress and from then on continued to design clothes. \n Celebrities really love her clothes and you regularly see her creations walking down the red carpet for the Oscar ceremony. One of her most famous is Gena Davis' transparent gown. \n Pamela Dennis' company had been bought up by conglomerate Pegasus (now the Leiber Group) but in early 2001 they fired her from her own company. They did this in a very violent manner with armed security men bursting into her salon and even stealing clothing. \n   Pamela could not use her own name, but continued designing under another name from 2002. Then in 2004, she managed to buy back her company and was deep into plans for a Spring 2005 collection to be shown in Fall 2004. She is really over the moon to be back in the fashion business and we look forward to seeing her lovely clothes again soon. It didn\u2019t take long before Pamela became a darling of the media. Major fashion and lifestyle publications such as InStyle, Allure, Elle, Glamour, People, Vogue and Town & Country began to tell her story and show her clothing while Architectural Digest even featured a spread on Pamela\u2019s home. Pamela quickly became a fixture as a fashion commentator on entertainment programs such as \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d, \u201cExtra\u201d, \u201cE! Entertainment\u201d and \u201cThe View\u201d.

{"designer_name":"Patricia Underwood","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/patricia-underwood\/"],"biography":"Patricia Underwood was born in Maidenhead, UK in 1948. After college, Patricia briefly worked at Buckingham Palace as a secretary. \n In 1967, she moved to New York and took an evening class in millinery at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Then she set up her hat business. Her under-stated creations fit the New York scene, where she works with fashion designers like Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Richard Tyler, Michael Kors and Isaac Mizrahi, who mirror her modernist abstract forms. \n Patricia Underwood's hats have been worn in films like Sabrina, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Six Days\/Seven Nights, Return to Paradise, Austin Powers, The Imposters, and the Pallbearers. Recording artists R. Kelly and Mariah Carey have used her hats for their music videos and recent tours. \n   Her hats are in the peranent collections of the Metropolitan Museum Costume Institute in New York, the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York and the Philadelphia Art Museum. Patricia has been honoured with a Coty Award, a CFDA American Accessories Achievement award and the Fashion Group International Entrepreneu of the Year award. Subtle yet interesting manipulations of traditional hat shapes are characteristic of Underwood's hat designs. She relies completely on shape and proportion rather than ornamentation. Her hats are noted for their Spartan modesty which makes them into sculptures for the head. She is currently a board member of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Patricia Underwood hats are sold in select department stores and boutiques throughout the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. In the middle 1990s she added coordinating scarves, shawls, and gloves to her collection. Her work is mostly ready-to-wear, available through department and specialty stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman, and has her own in-store boutique in the latter. Additionally, Underwood continues to do custom work for a select client\u00e9le and has expanded her horizons into Europe and Japan.","the_look":"The outstanding characteristic of millinery designer Patricia Under-wood's hats is they are, for the most part, completely unadorned. There are no added trimmings, no flowers, ribbons, or even hatbands on her pieces. The shape and the materials are the statement, they provide all the texture and color she feels is necessary. Underwood works with a variety of traditional millinery materials; various straw braids, fur felts, real fur, and knitted yarns, in addition to more unusual materials such as fake furs and her signature sewn strips of leather and suede.\nUnderwood's hats are designed specifically to work with clothing and to complement it. She strives to avoid overwhelming the wearer, and to avoid crossing the fine line between the flattering and the absurd in millinery. \nUnderwood's strength lies in transforming traditional hat shapes and types and creating new interpretations of these classic forms. The change may be made by the use of an unexpected material, or by her subtle manipulation of the form, giving a familiar shape an entirely new look. \nBy changing the expected relationships between the elements of the hat, the crown, and the brim, Underwood creates modern versions of virtually any forms. Her aesthetic is in concert with the minimalist fashions of designers such as Giorgio Armani and Calvin Klein; she takes the forms we are familiar with and eliminates detail until they are reduced to their essential shape.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Patricia Underwood"]}
{"designer_name":"Patrick Cox","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/patrick-cox\/"],"biography":"Patrick Cox was born in Edmonton, Canada in 1963. An early interest in British fashion, brought him to Cordwainer's College, London where he studied from 1983 to 1985. \n While a student, he designed a line of footwear for Vivienne WESTWOOD's Witches collection, notably gold platform shoes with large knots. He was subsequently invited to design for the young British design house Bodymap and also for John GALLIANO. He actually started his career making shoes in 1985. He started using the fleur-de-lis as his Logo. \n Cox quickly became known for wittily incorporating materials such as chain mesh, silk fringes and crucifixes into classic womens shoe silhouettes. Gradually he refined his style into one of increased classicism. He now sells strappy sandals, kitten heels and calfskin pumps as well as his outrageous designs. \n   In 1991, he opened his own store in London, which showcases his footwear designs alongside antique furniture. His first success was a customized Dr. Marten shoe, with its toe stripped to reveal a steel toe cap. In 1993, he introduced his \"Wannabe\" loafers. These are flat and stacked-heeled shoes of bulky, exaggerated proportions that appeal to both sexes. This Wannabe model is made of python skin. Customers besieged his shop to buy these shoes, even attempting bribery. The Wannabe shoe has inspired essays in serious newspapers and he has sold 400,000 pairs. They come in 20 new colours each season. In 1993, he launched PC's, a cheaper diffusion range of high fashion \"fun\" shoes which revitalized and repopularised the jelly sandal. The Wannabe madness led to Cox opening a second London store in 1995. But life isn't all a scream for Cox, he works too hard to have a social life, spends 6 months of the year in Italy getting his shoes made, and countless days on planes. But this is the price he has to pay for his success. He has retail stores in the USA, England and France and has also created a Wannabe line of clothing for men and women, as well as purse and small accessories. The launch of his own London shop in 1991 gave Cox the opportunity to show his collections as a whole, displaying the brash alongside the sophisticated. His audience soon came from both the devotees of the off-the-wall fashion experimentation of King's Road and the classic chic of the Sloane Square debutante. Cleverly, his shop was geographically situated between the two. As of 1999 the designer's wholly owned business, Patrick Cox International, had annual turnover of L19 million ($30 million), earned not only from his flagship footwear line but from apparel, jewelry, bags, and ties. That same year, Cox was widely criticized for a two-page spread in the glossy men's magazine FHM, showing the feet of a man who appeared to have hung himself. Critics called the suicide-themed depiction \"tasteless.\" Cox announced his first fragrance line for men and women, \"High,\" in partnership with Paris-based IFF in 2000. It debuted at the upscale British department store Harvey Nichols before being introduced into Asian markets. The scent typifies the Cox image: fun, addictive, and \"of the moment.\" For his ad campaign 2002, Cox enlisted model Sophie Dahl, who made news as the naked girl advertising YSL Opium pefume in 2001. Cox has managed to persuade Sophie to take her clothes off again, for his shoe campaign. In 2003, Patrick Cox has been tapped as the designer of French shoe house Charles Jourdan. Since he spent his childhood in West Africa, he speaks fluent French so fits in well with the great French shoe house. He has immersed himself in the Charles Jourdan archives and is confident of making contemporary shoes as successful as in the past. Patrick's advertisements for 2003 have featured popular model Sophie Dahl. He can usually persuade her to take most of her clothes off so that the viewer can concentrate on her feet and see his shoes well.","the_look":"In no time at all he was designing shoes to accompany the collections of the young English designers who were then flavor of the month on the international fashion circuit. Cox shod the feet to fit the willful perversities of Bodymap, the calculated eccentricity of John Galliano, and the ladies-who-lunch chic of Alistair Blair.\nCox went on to design his own label collections with such delightfully named styles as Chain Reaction, Rasta, and Crucifix Court. These were typical, hard-edged classic women's silhouettes given the Cox treatment\u2014chain mesh, silk fringes and crucifixes suspended from the heels. Witty and amusing as these styles were, they had limited appeal and Cox would not have attained his current prominence had he not sought a larger audience.\nSelling shoes alongside antiques was a novelty that appealed to the press and boosted Cox's profile. There was something delightful in the presentation of shoes balanced on the arms of Louis XVI gilt chairs or popping out of the drawers of beautiful old dressers. The shoes gained an aura of respectability; a sense of belonging to some tradition, which perfectly complemented Cox's reinterpretation of classic themes. No longer was there a typical Cox customer; they were the young and not so young. Cox took great delight when elderly ladies appreciated his more subtle styling; his women's shoes even rivaled those of Manolo Blahnik in their sophistication\u2014a calculated move.\nCox is the shoe designer who admits there is little you can do with shoes. The very nature of footwear imposes constraints upon the designer, where there are fewer problems for the clothing designer. Cox sees shoes as more architectural than clothes; a free standing form with an inside and out. Yet these restrictions do not stop him producing fresh contemporary styles which still work within the perceived framework of what a classic silhouette should be.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":["2002 High (W)","2002 High (M)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Patrick Cox","Charles Jourdan"]}

He attended Jackson State University where he studied art history. \n He worked with a tailor in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, before moving to New York in 1976 to study at Parsons School of Design. \n In 1979, he went to Paris and began his career in the fashion business by designing and selling cut-out cotton tube dresses, on the pavements of the city. He soon has a large following for his whimsical clothes. He also did a stint at a Rive Gauche boutique and designed for Benetton. Kelly also became a costume designer for Le Palais nightclub. \n   Huge buttons, abbreviated hemlines and a talent for tromp l'oeil, marked him as a natural New Yorker in Paris. His colourful clothes were a product of his Mississippi childhood and his long-held fascination with antique clothes. He so impressed his French compatriots that he became the first American designer to be elected to the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. Patrick was very unusual in many ways. He was certainly one of the first openly gay black fashion designers. Kelly's promising career was cut short by an early death on 1st January, 1990. He died in Paris, of bone marrow disease, a brain tumour and complications from AIDS. On 28th March, 1990, the Fashion Institute of Technology, in New York held a memorial to Patrick Kelly. They filled the windows of their 7th Avenue showrooms with his creations. All his friends in the fashion industry, and the models who had worked with him, and the clientele who had worn his clothes, gathered together to remember him with great sadness. The first retrospective of the design work of Patrick Kelly is being held at the Brooklyn Museum of Art from April to September 2004. It is in celebration of the opening of the BMA's new front entrance pavilion and public plaza, a $ 63 million dollar project of the City of Brooklyn and supporters of the museum.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Paul Costelloe","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/paul-costelloe\/"],"biography":"Paul Costelloe was born in Ireland in 1945 of Irish and American parents. He studied fashion design at the Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale, in Paris from 1967 to 1969. \n He started his career as assistant to Jacques Esterel from 1969-71. After that he did freelance design work in Milan and London, as well as New York from 1972-1979 when he worked with Anne Fogarty and others. \n He started his own company in 1979 and has built up a loyal client base who depend on his classic tailoring, sophisticated separates and knits. These are fashioned from the finest quality linens, cottons and tweeds, and his collections move into luxurious elegance for stylish evening clothes. \n   The small fashion company has since grown into a multimillion-pound concern. Until recently, the collections were shown seasonally at the British Designer Show at Olympia in London, where Costelloe was always a popular figure. Yet following a trend established by several other London designers, he began showing at smaller, more distinctive venues. Paul has been happily married since 1983 and has 7 children. He himself was the youngest of seven children, and his wife was one of seven also. Seven seems to be their lucky number. In the 80's, Paul Costelloe was called to Kensington Palace by Princess Diana to discuss some clothes she required. She invited him to submit some sketches, but he mentioned that Fergie (the Duchess of York) was purchasing his clothes. There was something of a fashion competition between these two Royal ladies and hearing this did not please Princess Diana, who afterwards did not buy Costelloe's clothes. There has been a recent rapid growth to this Irish designer's career due to his shrewd involvement with a major investment company. This has enabled him to join the ranks of designers with committed corporate backing. He has six stand alone stores, and is now expanding his export business and is involved in high-profile sports sponsorship. For Spring 2001, Paul Costelloe went back to his roots with a \"Parisian Afternoon\". He used very European styling with splashes of fur, with very subdued colours from white to maroon and olive. For Autumn 2001, Paul Costelloe was inspired by dashing romance and the English rose. After 23 years, Paul Costelloe is again one of Britain's top-most favourite designers. He has heightened his profile within Europe by becoming a sponsor of a Formula One auto racing team. In addition, he designed 30 suites in the Star Court Hotel, the largest hotel convention center in Limerick, Ireland, and created uniforms of orange fleece, with baseball caps, for the floor staff of Sainsbury's supermarkets in Britain. In 2000, he opened a shop in the Knightsbridge section of London and hoped to break into the U.S. market in the near future.","the_look":"Renowned for his use of natural fibers and fabrics, the best-quality wools and silks, and a particular bias toward traditional Irish linen, Costelloe clothes are one of the most subtle, understated, yet beautifully designed and manufactured collections available today. Acknowledging his love of Giorgio Armani's tailoring and the influence of Italian taste and style on the cut and flair of his collections, Costelloe always manages to fit an inspirational visit to Italy into his schedule before commencing the design of a new collection.\nIn general, three collections are produced each season under the Costelloe label, including the main line range (elegant, formal, and quietly sexy), the diffusion range called Dressage (country casual, timeless, and more suited to weekend dressing), and a third collection, the Studio Line, which was launched in 1992 and features what has been decribed as \"investment tailoring,\" in neoclassic colors. The clothes are aimed at today's modern career woman who has a distinctive, quiet taste and understated sophistication.\nCostelloe's spring-summer 1992 collection was an example of the designer at his peak. A series of sharp, sugary suits in pink, yellow, and green wool opened the collection. Teamed with short, flirty, polka dot skirts or blouses and oversize double crown hats, they were perfect for summer events like Ascot or garden parties. Ladylike check-cotton suits followed. Teamed with straw boaters and decorated with Costelloe's distinctive brass buttons, the look was demure and pristine, offset by soft kid gloves and gold jewelry. Like Armani, Costelloe loves beige, and this color, in various hues, features strongly in nearly all of his collections. \nThe controversy did not impede Costelloe's success as a designer. He continued to find acclaim using natural materials such as lambswool, tweeds, and linens, and featuring low-key styling which melded both with his personality and with Irish tradition, as noted by Tim Brannigan in the Irish News. Brannigan explained that Costelloe considered clothing a frame and woman the picture within it; the frame should never take away from the picture. Although Costelloe sometimes introduces surprises into his collections, such as combining checks with floral prints in 1997, his designs remain elegant and unaffected by short-lived trends.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/paulcostelloeofficial","brands":["Paul Costelloe"]}
{"designer_name":"Paul Iribe","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/paul-iribe\/"],"biography":"He was born Paul Iribarnegaray in Angouleme, France in 1883. Iribe was educated in Paris. He studied at the College Rollin as well as the Ecole des Beaux Arts from 1908 to 1910 where his companions included George Barbier and his cousin Pierre Brissaud, as well as Monvel, Besnard, Georges Lepape and George Martin. All became famous illustrators later on. \n In his early twenties, he became an apprentice printer at Le Temps newspaper. From 1900, he submitted illustrations to such French satirical papers as Rire, Sourire, and L'Assiette au beurre. \n He became famous in 1908 as an illustrator of fashion, when Paul Poiret, who was looking for an artist to present his clothes in an original manner, asked him to compile a promotional publication. The resulting brochure \"Les Robes de Paul Poiret\" was widely influential both in terms of fashion and of illustrative style. The illustration on the right is from that brochure of 1908. \n   He set up his own studio in Paris, where he produced designs for fashion, furniture, fabrics and wallpapers. Iribe's illustrations were clean, crisp and balanced. He kept background objects to a minimum and concentrated on the stylish outline and witty detail of the garments. A contributor to Vogue and Femina, Iribe also designed advertisements for the house of Paquin and Callot Sisters, designed perfume bottles, fabrics for the textile giant Bianchini-Ferier as well as furniture and interiors. From 1914, Iribe spent six years in Hollywood, working on film costumes and theatrical interiors for Paramount Film Studio. He worked for Cecil B. De Mille. He returned to Paris in 1920. Paris in the early 20's was full of poets, painters, composers, designers, decorators and of course artists. Paul Iribe mixed with and enjoyed the company of Jean Cocteau and many others. The Gazette du Bon Ton was a witty, sophisticated art and fashion magazine published monthly from 1911 until 1925 when it was merged with Conde Nast's Vogue. The Gazette attracted some of the best artists of the time, including Iribe who contributed clear, stylish fashion plates along with Barbier, Bakst, Benito, Drian, Lepape and many others. Some of the best examples of his work date from that time. Paul Iribe divided the time till his death in 1935, between contributing satirical illustrations to the weekly political paper Le Temoin and designing jewellery for Chanel. He died in 1935 at the age of 52.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Pauline Trigere","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/pauline-trigere\/"],"biography":"Pauline Trigere was a French-born American fashion designer, known for her crisp, tailored cuts and innovative ideas. \n Pauline Trigere was born in Paris, France in 1909 to Russian Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 parents. She knew how to operate a sewing machine by the age of 10 and assisted her dressmaker mother. Her father was a tailor who had made military uniforms for the Russian aristocracy and her mother was a dressmaker. Pauline grew up in an atmosphere of fine tailoring. \n When she was a teenager, lack of money prompted her to make a dress for herself. It was plaid taffeta, its collar had 3 layers of organdy edged with red, green and blue piping. For fun, she made a copy of this dress in 1971. \n   After leaving school, Pauline was employed as a trainee cutter at Martial et Armand in the Place Vendome, Paris. It is said that her employer remarked after a few days, that she already knew all he had to teach. She also worked as the freelance designer, going to the fashion houses of Paris to sell her sketches. While there, she met American designer Adele Simpson, a buyer from America, who told her about the wonders of the New York fashion world.  So in 1937, at the aged 25, she moved to New York. There she first found work at Ben Gerschel, where Adele Simpson worked, and later became assistant designer at Hattie Carnegie. She then became assistant designer to Travis BANTON at Hattie CARNEGIE. By that time she had married Lazar Hadley and had two sons Jean-Pierre and Philippe. In 1942, Trigere decided to open her own fashion house, which was managed by her brother Robert Trigere. Her marriage had been dissolved. Her first small collection of 12 custom-made dresses was taken to department store buyers all across the country and by 1945, Trigere was a respected New York label. She began producing ready-to-wear lines in the late 40's. In 1949, Trigere won her first Coty award. She later won it again in 1951 and 1959 and was inducted into the Coty Hall of Fame. In the 1950s she started to produce costume jewelry to accompany her outfits, like many other fashion houses at the time. Trigere is also known for designing Patricia Neal's sophisticated wardrobe in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Pauline was awarded the CFDA Hall of Fame award in 1993. In 2000, Pauline introduced a line of accessories especially for stylish elderly people. Her collection is available on line at goldviolin.com and features such practical items as a red ostrich box for pills and purses to hold hearing aids, as well as lots of little blankets to match a lady's handbag. In the year 2000, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Pauline Trigere was one of those honoured, and here is a picture of her plaque. In 2001, the Consul General of France Richard Duque, awarded her that country's highest accolade, the Legion of Honour. In June 2002, Pauline Trigere died at the age of 93. She told her relatives that she wanted to wait a while as she had a hairdresser's appointment the next morning. For some spiteful reason, for many years John Fairchild of Womens Wear Daily, would not mention her name in his publications. Other media people of course, often did. After she died, Pauline's son Jean-Pierre Radley thanked the journalists personally.","the_look":"Trigere's own elegance and Gallic charm, were renowned as was her favourite method of keeping fit - standing on her head. She wore her own clothes, adding printed scarves, tied her own way and with her own collection of handsome jewellery including her signature turtles, which she pinned on a shoulder or a cuff. \nShe worked by cutting and draping bolts of fabric. She was known for her crisp, tailored cuts and innovative ideas, particularly with outerwear. She is credited with the introduction of removable scarves and collars from dresses and coats. \nTrigere also created dresses with jewelry attached, sleeveless coats, reversible coats and opera capes. One of her capes is made from black blanket wool and angora reversible to a shocking pink. Many of her coats are designed to be worn with two interchangeable dresses. Fur trims appear often on her garments. Trigere was one of the first designers to use wool for evening wear. \nPauline Trig\u00e9re was more than a designer of women's clothing, she was a fabric artisan. \nDuring the 1940s Trig\u00e9re become known especially for her impeccable and imaginative tailoring of women's suits and coats. She made use of all weights of wool, from sheer crepes for eveningwear to thick tweeds for daytime coats. She was recognized early in her career as an innovator for such fashions as evening dresses made of wool or cotton, reversible coats and capes in all shapes and sizes. Another characteristic Trig\u00e9re feature is the luxurious touch of fur trim at necklines, cuffs, and hems. Before the 1960s, her palette was fairly subdued and she rarely used printed fabrics; during the 1960s and 1970s she began to use more prints and softer fabrics, always retaining a tailored touch. Her use of prints is bold and deliberate, the pattern is often used to complement the structure of the piece. Notwithstanding her extensive use of wool and tailoring techniques, Trig\u00e9re's clothing has always been unmistakably feminine.\nWhile she was an acknowledged innovator of fashions, she was also known for repeating and perfecting her most successful themes. For example, her princess line dress has consistently been considered to have no equal, and her rhinestone bra top, first introduced in 1967, was revived in 1985 and again in 1992. Throughout the evolution of fashion in the six decades, Trig\u00e9re worked within the mainstream while retaining her signature style. Simple elegance and timelessness are descriptions often applied to her work, but style was not her only concern. She insisted on the highest quality of materials to assure her clothing served her customers for years to come. Her collections were carefully planned so many pieces worked together, and complement past seasons' collections.\nTrig\u00e9re's work has been compared to that of two legendary French couturiers, Cristobal Balenciaga and Madeleine Vionnet. These designers were known for employing complex and unusual construction techniques to create simple, elegant silhouettes. Trig\u00e9re herself rarely sketched her ideas; like Balenciaga and Vionnet she designed by draping and cutting the actual fabric on a dress form or live model. The fabric itself is an important part of Trig\u00e9re's design process; it is her inspiration and her guide as it reveals what it is capable of doing. Trig\u00e9re's continued involvement with the creative process and her insistence on quality made her unique on New York's Seventh Avenue.","who_wears_it":["Duchess of Windsor","Claudette Colbert","lena Horne","Wynona Ryder"],"perfumes":["Pauline Trigere (W) (launched in 1973)","Liquid Chic (launch date unknown)"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}

She gravitated to Los Angeles' thriving underground music scene in the late 1970s, and waited tables at the once-popular Sushi on Sunset. She married a musician-turned-director, Jeff Levy. In the late 1980s, Skaist-Levy took courses at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, and one class project required her to make a hat. That led to her own line of millinery, which she sold under the name Helmet at stores like Barneys New York and Fred Segal, the top Los Angeles fashion retailer. \n Skaist-Levy also worked as a film stylist and knew former model\/hipster boutique owner Tracey Ross, who introduced her to Taylor around 1988. About five years older than Skaist-Levy, Taylor had a drama degree from Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University and lived in New York City after graduation. There she landed a role in the original Broadway production of Zoot Suit in 1979. She also appeared on television series like Taxi and Hill Street Blues, and had a bit part as a secretary in the 1984 Melanie Griffith thriller Body Double. \n   When Skaist-Levy and Taylor met, Taylor was expecting a child with her first husband, a musician named Chris Nash. Frustrated at the lack of stylish maternity wear in stores, she cut a pair of her prepregnancy jeans and sewed a panel into the waistline instead. The two women, whose friendship had been cemented by their love of fashion, decided to start a maternity-clothing line with just $200 each. They called it Travis, after Taylor's infant son, and their fledgling company thrived in the early 1990s with nearly $1 million in sales annually. But Skaist-Levy and Taylor were vexed by the relationship with store buyers. Skaist-Levy and Taylor decided to license the Travis name to someone else and let them take over the maternity sector. They turned their sights to another forgotten segment of the fashion industry. Working in Taylor's one-bedroom Los Angeles-area apartment, they began designing a line of T-shirts in good, form-fitting fabrics and enticing colors; they named the business Juicy. The line sold between $21 and $30 a piece, and quickly began selling out at the specialty boutiques that carried them. Soon they had to recruit Taylor's cleaning woman to help with their shipping demands. The Juicy line sold $1 million in its first year, and soon began appearing in department stores like Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom. Skaist-Levy and Taylor expanded the line to include dresses, skirts, and other casual wear. By 1996, they had $5 million in sales, which helped bankroll their higher-end, cheekily named \"Juicy Couture\" line in fall of 1997. The line expanded to an entire range of casual wear for women and then men, too, and added jeans and even yoga wear, but the Juicy velour track suit remained the staple and the fashion must-have of the millennial era. In 2003, Liz Claiborne bought the company for a reported $53 million and a percent of future sales, but Nash-Taylor and Skaist-Levy are still the heart of Juicy Couture, with responsibility for creative direction as well as day-to-day operations.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Jessica Alba","Tori Spelling","Eva Longoria","Mischa Barton","Eva Mendes","Britney Spears","Kate Moss","Suri","Madonna","Jessica Biel","Kate Beckinsale","Rachel Bilson","Katherine Heigl","Katy Perry","Kate Hudson","Katie Holmes"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Juicy Couture","Bird By Juicy Couture"]}

She is the youngest daughter of famed 20th-century artist Pablo Picasso and painter and writer Fran\u00e7oise Gilot. Paloma Picasso's older brother is Claude, her half brother is Paulo and her half sister is Maya. \n Paloma literally means \"dove\" (or \"pigeon\") in Spanish. Paloma Picasso is represented in many of her father's works, such as Paloma with an Orange and Paloma in Blue. \n Paloma Picasso lives in Lausanne, Switzerland. \n   Paloma Picasso's jewelry career began in 1968, when she was a costume designer in Paris. Some rhinestone necklaces she had created from flea market finds brought positive attention from critics, and she enrolled in a jewelry course. Soon, Yves Saint Laurent asked her to design accessories to accompany one of his collections, and by 1971 she was working for the Greek jewelry company Zolotas. She also designed sets for playwright and director Rafael Lopez-Cambil (also known as Rafael Lopez-Sanchez), whom she later married. In 1980 Picasso began designing jewelry for Tiffany & Co. of New York. Her early creations mixed color and varying gemstones in bold designs. She had long used the dove symbol and the color red as signatures of her work which she exploited throughout her career. Soon Picasso branched into new areas of design when in 1984 she began experimenting with fragrance, creating the very successful \"Paloma\" perfume for L'Or\u00e9al. Her husband, Lopez-Cambil, developed the visual image for the perfume with red and black packaging and shaped bottle. In the New York Post Picasso described it as intended for \"strong women like herself\". A cosmetics and bath line including body lotion, powder, shower gel, and soap were produced in the same year. In 2000, Picasso, known for her bold colors and books, took her home accessories in a new direction. The once bright primary colors gave way to gray, gold, and tan. This shift was also reflected in Picasso\u2019s personal appearance since she dispensed with the fire truck-engine-red lipstick favored by her since the age of 17. Picasso briefly lost interest in designing following the death of her father in 1973, at which time she played Countess Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory in Polish filmmaker Walerian Borowczyk's erotic film, Immoral Tales (1974), receiving praise from the critics for her beauty. She has not acted since. While designing sets for playwright and director Rafael Lopez-Cambil (also known as Rafael Lopez-Sanchez) a relationship developed, and in 1978 the couple married in a black-and-white themed wedding.

She gathered beads, bottle tops, seeds, sea-washed glass, anything and everything, secreting her treasures in little piles around the house. \n These personal tokens soon followed her around in an ever-expanding bag, until she began to string them together to make, for her, a tactile diary of her existence: a button from a loved ones shirt, a shell from a beautiful beach, a found treasure reminiscent of a person or place. \n   The jewellery told stories, held secrets and helped a shy child express herself through the tangle of bracelets and amulets. By the time she reached her teenage years the entire length of her arms were entwined in a mosaic of colourful stones and she jangled when she walked. Pippa Small\u2019s early childhood travels were to have an enormous influence on her as she became fascinated by other cultural ways of being in the world.

While there, he was co-founder of a Richmond retail shop A Sunny Day. He later joined the sportswear company John Meyer in New York. In the mid-1970s, eventually, he was approached by his then employer, The Vera Companies, famous for their polyester double-knit pantsuits, to design a fashion collection for them. Soon after that, Ellis presented his first women's sportswear line, called Portfolio, in November 1976.

He studied at the Accademia delle Belle Arti in Rome. \n His first job was working for designer Emilio Schuberth. When he was 20, a Florentine businessman put on a fashion show, where it was his intention to show five of Capucci's creations. However, the other couturiers felt up-staged by his gowns and refused to allow it. The press however insisted the next day, to see the gowns, which sold immediately. He was so talented that since then he has been included in the shows representing Italy's finest designers. \n   Capucci was considered a \"boy wonder\" right from his debut because his gowns were regarded as fabric sculptures, with forms and colours that sometimes followed the body and sometimes exaggerated it. They gave a magical aura to the women who wore them. In 1950 he opened his own house, and for ten years he was acclaimed in Italy. In 1956 he was awarded the Medal of Gold of Venice and in the same year, he received a message of admiration from French designer Christian Dior. In 1957, the fashion writer Alison Adburgham called him the \"Givenchy of Rome\" and said that he designed for an abstract woman, the woman you can never meet. His extravagance meant that the wearer becomes secondary to the gown. In 1962, he opened his couture salon in Paris in the rue Cambon. In 1968, he returned to Rome, where he re-established himself in the via Gregoriana. Capucci has called his work a \"study in form\". In his approach to the female figure, he refuses to limit himself to a curved cylinder. One of his most important collections was based on the box shape: each tunic or dress had two sie seams stiffened and squared away from the body. The purity of Capucci's work extended to his selling technique. His fashion shows were conducted in silence, he refused to ever duplicate a gown, and a client wishing to own a Capucci would have to buy it from the collection show, if she could fit into it. He hated publicity, or even recognition. Around 1980 Roberto retired from the day-to-day running of his house, although he did design many dresses in the 1980's. Since 1982 he has arranged for collections of his clothes to be shown in exhibitions all over the world. On the 50th Anniversary of his first success, an exhibition was held in Florence in February 2001. A book was published on that occasion called \"Roberto Capucci - Timeless Creativity.\" In 1995, at the age of 65, Roberto Capucci accepted teaching posts in China, at the Universities of Beigin, Xi'an and Shanghai, of the invitation of the Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade. Gianbattista Valli was a designer at the house of Capucci from 1988 to 1990, when he joined Fendi. A real surprise during Milan Fashion Week in February 2003. The first runway show for the house of Capucci in so many years. The master himself, silver-haired and ramrod straight, sat in the front row with Spanish designer Sybilla while Belgian designer Bernhard Willhelm (born 1973) presented a parade of soft, casual clothes with references to Capucci's boxy sculptures from so long ago. The new plans were the branchild of fashion entrepreneur Franco Bruccolari. Capucci himself is spry and actively involved in the enterprise at the age of 74. Willhelm is only the first of several young designers who will be creating for the house. Tara Subkoff of Imitation of Christ will be involved, as well as the Spanish designer Sybilla. Capucci has an archive of 30,000 designs which these young designers immerse themselves into.

{"designer_name":"Ralph Lauren","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/ralph-lauren\/"],"biography":"  Ralph Lauren was born as Ralph Lipschitz on October 14, 1939. His Jewish parents, Frank and Frida, who originated from Russia had the opportunity to give him a middle-class, but not too glamorous life. Ralph also had three older brothers. With two of them he actually had to share a bedroom. \n Ralph Lauren wanted to be different, so at very young age he started working after-schools. He would then use the earned money to buy himself stylish, expensive suits. This soon gave him a trendy reputation in his surroundings. \n   He attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and night classes at the City College of New York, where he took business courses. He also worked part time at Alexander as a stock boy and salesman. He then served 6 months in the Army. Although Ralph Lauren's future was deemed to be in the clothing and fashion industry, Ralph Lauren decided not to attend any fashion school. Instead he went to the City College in Manhattan where he studied Business. However after two years Ralph Lauren dropped out because college couldn't live up to his expectations. In 1964 he joined Brooks Brothers, the establishment outfitters in New York. This same year, he also met and married his wife Ricky, who was from Vienna and studying at college. They now have 2 sons Andrew and David and a daughter Dylan. Dylan has an Upper East side Candy Store, Andrew is a Film producer and David works for Polo, expanding and refining the company's internet presence. In 1967 he joined Beau Brummell Neckwear, where he created wide, hand-made, expensive neckties. He tried to sell these to Bloomingdales, but they wanted him to take his name tag off and make the ties narrower, which of course he refused. Within a few months, when his ties were selling briskly in competitive stores, they agreed to carry his ties exactly as he had designed them. His brand name was POLO. In 1968, with a 50,000 $ loan and his tie designs, Ralph Lauren started his company \"Polo Fashions\". Characteristic for Ralph Lauren's ties were the Italian colours and designs and the very wide structure of the tie. His tie business was an immediate and immense success. After this Ralph Lauren started focusing on menswear. In 1871 he opened his first own store. Like his tie business, his menswear collection was an immediate success with the preppy, fashionable young Ivy League men. Only a year later, in 1972, Ralph Lauren also designed his first collection for women. Ralph Lauren's casual, elegant clothes had become a marketing hit. He opened his first store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. He produced a collection of tailored womens shirts. In 1972 he launched a complete range of garments for women, made of cashmere, cotton and tweed. His clothes projected a purely American style of casual chic. He dressed women in literal versions of menswear, pleated trousers, wing collars, pleated shirt fronts, and tweed hacking jackets. All of his collections have themes, in 1978 Ralph Lauren introduced the casual\/sophisticated \"prairie look\", denim skirts worn over layers of white cotton petticoats, fringed buckskin jackets and full sleeved soft blouses. In 1980 he showed hooded capes, linen ruffled blouses, madras cotton shirts and full skirts as part of the \"American frontier\" look. In 1983 he went where no designer had gone before. He started his home collection of sheets, towels, flatware and furniture. He created products that revolved around themes. Ralph Lauren success has been due to his ability to sell a thoroughbred image to the public. With Ralph Lauren, you are not buying a product, you are buying into a lifestyle and you become part of a larger traditional world. Ralph is very socially conscious. He worries about the world's problems. In 1989 Ralph Lauren founded the Nina Hyde Centre for Breast Cancer in Washington, USA and since then has helped raise millions of dollars to fight this disease through various initiatives. He himself had a brain tumour in 1988 which was successfully removed, so he understands the pain and fear of cancer. In 1992 Ralph Lauren outfitted the American team for America's Cup yacht race. In 1993 Polo Sport store was opened across from the flagship store on Madison Avenue, New York and in 1995 Ralph Lauren introduced several new lines such as Purple Label tailored mens suiting, Ralph Lauren paint collection, infants and toddlers wear, and the Polo Jeans Company. For two years 1995 and 1996 he received the CFDA award, one for Mens wear designer of the year and the second for Womens wear. In the year 2000, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Ralph Lauren was one of those honoured. the label By 1997 when he was selling more than $ 5 billion per year, with 155 shops around the world, employing more than 3,000 people Ralph Lauren went public with his company on the New York stock exchange. His estimated net worth is around $ l billion. The Ralph Lauren Company is in private hands. The company consists of more than 350 contract manufacturers worldwide and owns around 400 retail and outlet RL stores worldwide.","the_look":"His designs blend romance, innovation and tradition with inspirations that travel across time and culture: African safaris, English aristocracy, Parisian caf\u00e9 life, Old Hollywood, the Western frontier, Russian revolutionaries, Native American cultures, Eastern prep schools and competitive sports.

Even as a child of 5 years old, he loved to join his grandmother on her sewing machine. All his sister's friends asked him to make clothes for their dolls. All through his childhood years, he was sketching garments as a hobby. \n   He studied at the High School of Art, and subsequently joined the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. He graduated in 1963 when he was 21 years old. While he was studying, he worked as a copy boy at Womens Wear Daily, the fashion newspaper. He did want a job as an illustrator, but could not get it. After graduating, his first real job was at Dan Millstein, in New York as Assistant designer. Millstein was a mean-tempered tyrant, but Calvin stayed there because he got the chance to go with him to Paris, to copy designs, and he was able to see the French fashion scene. In Spring of 1964, Calvin married Jayne, his childhood sweetheart and they had a daughter Marci. In 1965, he left Millstein and joined Halldon Ltd., another prestigious coat maker but alongside he was designing his own garments. His first mention in the press came when in 1967 a trade magazine admired his work. In 1967, he and his friend Barry Schwartz, borrowed money from their friends and formed their own company. His first order was in 1968 when Bonwit Teller, the famous store on 5th Avenue in New York, ordered $ 50,000 worth of garments. They put one Calvin Klein design in each of their eight windows. This was an amazing thing for a new designer and overnight he became a success. He gradually became more and more successful with his beautifully stitched and designed clothes. In the early 70's Calvin Klein realized the importance of elegant day wear separates and mix-and-match garments, what the Americans call \"sportswear\".

He introduced his menswear line, his designer jeans and his first perfume \"Calvin Klein\". The following year 1979, he introduced Calvin Klein for Men, Jeans for Men, and also appeared on the cover of the May edition of NEWSWEEK magazine. In 1979 his daughter was kidnapped for ransom and he played a heroic role in rescuing her safely. This gained a lot of media attention.

So no matter what Gaultier or Galliano are showing, he keeps his palette defiantly muted, his lines aggressively clean, and his style grounded in reality. \nCalvin Klein's aim, as he himself said, \"I want to combine the refinement and elegance of the couture tradition with my belief that clothes should be realistic and wearable.\" His aim is understated sophistication using luxurious fabrics like silk, suede and cashmere. He uses no fussy detail and uses sober colours that appeal to both men and women.

He graduated from London's Central Saint Martins Academy, and in 2005 was named creative director for Givenchy womenswear, haute couture and in May 2008 he was named as menswear and accesories designer of the Givenchy men's division. \n Tisci was born in Taranto, Italy. The city of Taranto is said to be mythologically tied with mermaids and marines, which often influences Tisci in his collections for both Givenchy ready-to-wear and haute couture. \n After graduating from London's Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in 1999, Tisci worked for a succession of companies such as Puma and Coccapani before signing a three-year contract with Ruffo Research, which launched the careers of a plethora of fashion designers, such as Sophia Kokosalaki. \n   Once his contract had expired in July of 2004, Tisci began to work on his own collection, which he exhibited for Milan Fall 2005\/2006 Fashion week. Shortly after, he was appointed by Givenchy as the creative director and made the following statement \"I am delighted to join Givenchy and very proud to be able to bring my vision to this prestigious French haute couture house, whose history inspires me.\" On February 28th 2005, Riccardo Tisci was officially appointed as the creative director of the Haute Couture, ready-to-wear and accessories lines for Givenchy. Givenchy boss Marco Gobbetti, spoke of Tisci's appointment as being a \"perfect fit for us\". Gobbetti adds, \"He [Tisci] has an elegance that is very modern, very contemporary and romantic at the same time\". Unlike the various designers before him who succeeded Mr. Givenchy himself, Tisci has encountered great success, both critically and financially. Especially in the realm of Haute Couture. Riccardo Tisci's runway presentations are highly stylized in terms of architecture and space. In 2011, Riccardo Tisci was appointed as new Creative Director for Dior, after John Galliano was fired by Dior for his anti-Semitic statements that caused extensive controversy in the fashion world.","the_look":"His apparent fascination with gothic touches (dark, languid dresses on sickly models for fall couture) and space-age minimalism (one ready-to-wear show featured white-clad models drifting aimlessly around a sterile-white sphere) have drawn new attention to the Givenchy brand.

{"designer_name":"Roy Halston Frowick","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/roy-halston-frowick\/"],"biography":"Roy Halston Frowick, also known as Halston was an iconic clothing designer of the 1970s. His long dresses or copies of his style were popular fashion wear in mid-1970s discotheques. \n Roy Halston Frowick was born in Des Moines, Iowa, USA, on 23rd April 1932. He attended the University of Indiana and the Chicago Institute. He began his career as a milliner and when he moved to designing women's wear, Newsweek dubbed him \"the premier fashion designer of all America.\" \n In 1953, he opened a millinery salon in a Chicago hotel, where his clientele included film actresses. He trained briefly with Charles James, the great fashion designer. In 1958, he joined LILLY DACHE in New York, moving shortly after to the millinery salon of Bergdorf Goodman's New York department store. Halston designed hats for Jacqueline Kennedy including a beige felt pillbox that was widely copied. She wore many pillbox hats with the dresses which Oleg Cassini designed for her. \n   In 1966, Halston began designing ready-to-wear garments, leaving Bergdorf Goodman to open his own business. Halston Ltd., was founded in 1968 on Madison Avenue, New York. During the late 60's and early 70's Halston established a reputation as a designer of knitwear, sweaters and wide legged jersey trousers. He also made turtlenecks, long slinky halter-neck dresses, cashmere dresses for day and evening, sweater sets and boxy square jackets and coats. American socialites considered him the best evening wear designer. He also tie-dyed chiffon and used matte jersey in many of his collections. In 1972, he made a shirtwaister of Ultrasuede which inspired many imitations. Ultrasuede was considered to be a Halston trademark. In the 60's, designer Stephen Sprouse worked at the house of Halston for 3 years. In 1973, Norton Simon incorporated Halston's business for $ 12 million and named this new division of its conglomerate Halston Enterprises Inc. In 1978, he moved all his activities to the Olympic Towers Building, in Manhattan, New York. His popularity in the 70's made him a social figure, most famously among the set that frequented New York's Disco named Studio 54. Halston was famous for his draped jersey dresses and lean trouser suits. He was very much inspired by classical Greek and Roman draping. In 1983, Halston signed with J.C. Penney, the large department store, for a cheaper line, which caused many of his higher class clientele to leave him. Despite his achievements, his increasing drug use and failure to meet deadlines (he was reluctant to hire junior designers to design licensed products) undermined his success. In October of 1984 he was fired from his own company and lost the right to design and sell clothes under his own name. In 1990, he died, when only 58 years old, of lung cancer from complications of AIDS in San Francisco, California. According to Salon.com, Halston was \"the first international fashion superstar\u2014and possibly the best designer America has ever had.\" As \"the first designer to realize the potential of licensing himself,\" his influence went beyond style to reshape the business of fashion. Through his licensing agreement with JC Penney, his designs were accessible to women at a variety of income levels. Although this practice is not uncommon today, it was a controversial move at the time Halston, his perfume, was sold in a bottle designed by Elsa Peretti and was the second biggest selling perfume of all time. New fragrances bearing the Halston name were introduced in 1994 and 1995, but the name and its legacy languished until the company was dismantled in 1996. French Fragrances Inc. bought the Halston scents; Tropic Tex Apparel bought the remainder of the Halston's products. To support the reintroduction of the Halston brand and image, Tropic Tex launched a major advertising campaign and brought Randolph Duke on board as creative director. Over the next few years, the Halston name was licensed for beds and linens, scarves, belts, handbags, hosiery, sunglasses, jewelry, timepieces, leather apparel, sleepwear, and foundations. In the capable hands of Duke, Halston Signature womenswear regained much of its cachet\u2014trunk shows at Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue sold over $200,000-worth of couture in a few days in 1997. A menswear launch, however, was not as successful and the overexposure in licensing caught up with Tropic Tex. After experiencing financial difficulties, Tropic Tex agreed to sell Halston International to the Connecticut-based Catterton Group in April 1998. Halston's new owners fired Duke and hired Kevan Hall, who had worked there briefly earlier in the year and abruptly left. Yet by 1999 Catterton had sold Halston's assets to Neema Clothing Ltd., which then hired Craig Natiello as design director. A new Halston Signature menswear line debuted in 2001 after a series of delays, and Natiello had settled in with his womenswear designs. While the Halston brand spun out of control during the designer's lifetime, it was nothing compared to after his death. In the 21st century, however, the name Halston was again conjured up images of elegance and luxury in womenswear was emerging in menswear as well. In the year 2000, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This was called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME'. Various designers have looked after the house of Halston. Randolph Duke from 1997-1998, his assistant Kevan Hall 1998-1999, followed by Craig Natiello who left in November 2001. Thai-born Piyawat joined Halston in April 2001. He was earlier with Anne Klein, Adrienne Vittadini and Vivienne Tam. When Craig Natiello left, he took over the design for Halston. He presented a successful Fall\/Winter 2002 collection, followed by another for Spring\/Summer 2003. The latest designer at the house of Halston is Bradley Bayou. Bradley is a Texan, 6'4\" tall, born in 1956 who is well-known for his extravagant couture gowns. Bayou joined Halston in December 2002 and has created the collections for Fall 2003 and for Spring\/Summer 2004 which was shown during New York Fashion Week in September 2003. Bradley's show for Spring 2004 consisted of 20 pieces shown to a very select crowd belonging to New York's social register. They nodded and smiled as each model stopped so that they could examine the clothes. Bayou captured the essence of Halston - seductive and glamorous evening wear intermixed with casual and chic daywear. All the gowns were suitable for red-carpet appearances with exquisite detailing, and craftsmanship. Laser cutting done in Switzerland was the secret, Bradley said. It is reported that a film is under production depicting the life of Halston, who will be played by Alec Baldwint. It will show the fashion icon and the life he led. Filming is due to start in Autumn 2004. Liza Minelli will probably play herself but there is no news about other stars who will play the celebrities who attended Studio 54 with him in the 1970's.","the_look":"If Halston ascribed the social function to the wearer, he himself was the consummate creator of the garment in formal terms and his work corresponded to the minimalism in American arts. His geometry of design, employing bias as the three-dimensional element causing the geometry to drape splendidly on the body, was as conceptual as that of Vionnet. Some design problems were played out in paper origami, as he created twisted forms in white paper on a black lacquer tray. Discovering such form, Halston projected it onto the body with absolute integrity, cutting as little as possible, and allowing the simplicity of the two-dimensional design to be felt, even as it assumed form on the body.\nLikewise Halston's colors were as selective as Mondrian's, preferring ivory, black, and red, but knowing that fuchsia, electric blue, or deep burgundy could provide accent and emphasis. Of textiles, he worked with cashmere, silk and rayon jerseys, double-faced wools, and Ultrasuede. \nHalston's eveningwear was acclaimed for its glittery, gossamer shimmer, but often unacknowledged for the same principles of simplicity. Working on the bias, Halston caressed the body with spiralling scarfs of form. His one-piece, held-at-the-shoulder \"orange-peel\" dress was the product of a deft hand, like that of the fruit peeler. His evening jackets were often nothing more than rings of material twisted into cocoon fantasies.","who_wears_it":["Debra Messing","Oprah Winfrey","Jenna Elfmann","Salma Hayek","Gloria Swanson","Deborah Kerr","Bianca Jagger","Liza Minelli","Bianca Jagger","Anjelica Huston","Lauren Bacall","Babe Paley","Elizabeth Taylor"],"perfumes":["1974  Halston (W)","1974  Halston for men","1975  Halston Classic (W)","1976  Halston Z-14 (M)","1976  Halston I-12 (M)","1980  Halston Night (W)","1983  Halston 101 (M)","1987  Halston Limited (M)","1988  Halston Couture (W)","1992  Nautica (M)","1993  Catalyst (W)","1994  Catalyst (M)","1995  Profumo di Montecatini (W)","1998  Z (for men)","1998 Sheer (W)","2000 That's Amore (W)","2000 That's Amore (M)","2001 Unbound (M)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Halston","Halston Heritage"]}

{"designer_name":"Raoul Dufy","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/raoul-dufy\/"],"biography":"Raoul Dufy was born in Le Havre, France in 1877 one of a family of 9 members. He left school at 14 to work in a coffee importing company. In 1895 when he was 18, he started evening classes in art at the Ecole Municipale des Beaux Arts there, and was influenced by Cezanne, Matisse and the Cubists. He developed a free and personal way of painting which had great charm and gaiety. His work was inspired by sport, the theatre, regattas and spectacles of various kinds. \n In 1900 after a year's military service, he won a scholarship to the Beaux Arts in Paris, where he was a fellow student of Braque. He came in contact with the Fauves, a group of artists who were developing a new style of painting characterized by bold handling of strong colours. \"Les Fauves\" means Wild Animals, and that is what other artists thought of this group. \n Dufy held his first one-man show in 1906 at the Salon d'Automne. He also illustrated books and designed sets for theatre, opera and ballet. \n   He worked closely with Paul Poiret, the designer. Dufy went to Munich in Germany in 1909 and brought back a new folk art, which Poiret used for decorations at his extravaganzas and parties. In 1911, along with Poiret, Dufy became involved in the development of dye techniques and colour printing. They called their factory Le Petit Usine. Dufy's fabrics aroused great interest. Poiret employed them extensively on coats, capes and dresses. When Poiret took his mannequins to the races they were the center of attraction. In 1912, he joined the French textile company Bianchini-Ferier as Artistic Director. He designed silks and brocades and made a series of tapestries. He also experimented with new themes and concepts. He remained with them from 1912 till 1928. The May 1920 issue of the Gazette du Bon Ton illustrated Dufy's many different geometric designs on a group of models wearing Poiret creations. In 1925, Poiret used a Dufy print for an evening dress which he displayed at the Exposition des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, which started the art style ART DECO. After 1930, Dufy became totally involved with his painting and relegated his textile designing to a minor role. In 1937 he decorated the Electricity Pavilion at the Paris Exhibition. Raoul Dufy died in Forcalquier, France, in 1953 at the age of 76.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

He came from a sophisticated family of architects and engineers. He took painting and music lessons, and was intending an engineering career. However, as a hobby, he designed dresses and in 1950 one of his friends secretly sent some of his sketches to a designer in Milan. They proved to be interesting and he was invited to join a salon, so he moved to Milan. He spent some time designing for the theatre and films. \n Giovanni Battista Giorgini, from Florence, was employed by American department stores to select and purchase Italian-made garments. He organized fashion shows to show the creations of Italian couturiers (many of whom were aristocrats). In 1951 the important American buyers came to Florence and saw the work of Fabiani, Schuberth, Fontana sisters and others. \n This is one of the reasons that Italian fashion became so popular with Hollywood celebrities and other socialites after World War II. \n   The show was such a success that another show was organized in 1952. Designers like Mila Schon, Forquet, Lancetti and others showed their designs. Renato Balestra presented his first designs at this show, to great admiration. It was the start of his fashion career.

In 1939, his work was used editorially in French and British Vogue, and he also produced one of the prettiest covers of the year, a milliners shop full of summers bows and flowers, ribbons and laces. \n At the outbreak of war, he joined the French army, fought through until the fall of France and in early 1941 reached New York. Here his career effectively began and he was established as a regular and expected contributor to American Vogue. \n   In 1947, Bouche taught illustration at Parsons School of Design in New York. Parsons maintain archives of his drawings for research purposes. Bouche illustrated the pages of Vogue throughout the 40's, 50's and early 60's, communicating the relationship between clothes and their wearers with accuracy and humour. In 1956 Bouche sketched a young Sammy Davis Jr. for Vogue calling him \"a meager sharp fellow, crammed with talent.\" He went to Japan in 1957 and in the detailed feature shown below, sketched the two hour make up ritual of Geisha girls in Kyoto. There has always been a place in Vogue for exotic travel tales like this. By 1958, Rene Bouche commanded the field at Vogue but he lived on for a bare five years to enjoy his seniority. In April 1962 TIME magazine put on the cover, a beautiful painting that Rene Bouche had made of Sophia Loren. At the early age of 57, Bouche died suddenly in England in July 1963. Vogue published his obituary written by William S. Lieberman, Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He said \"Bouche in his narrow field developed superbly and became a master of social portraiture.\" Bouche's death seems to have marked the moment when Vogue's heart set itself against drawings to illustrate fashion. After his death, no further fashion drawings appeared in American Vogue that year, or indeed for a long time afterwards.","the_look":"Initially his work was black and white, firmly and accurately drawn, and frequently spread across a double page of Vogue.

His drawings of women were elegant, vibrant and often amusing.

Said the artist \"the model is the drawing, I am attracted to fashion illustration as a form of personal expression, interpreting the mood of the model according to what she is wearing. She is a young, active woman, her gestures and movements inspire me and because I work so fast she can always be caught in motion.\" There was a shape and feeling in Duncan's dynamic brushstrokes and glowing gouache colours, which, coupled with his ability to capture a likeness in just a few lines, were much appreciated by American Vogue. They regularly commissioned from him both fashion drawings and portraits of elegantly dressed socialites. He regularly contributed to Harpers Bazaar, the New Yorker magazine and American Vogue during the 1980's. The outstanding characteristic of Duncan's work was his use of blocks of high-voltage colour.

{"designer_name":"Rudi Gernreich","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/rudi-gernreich\/"],"biography":"Rudi Gernreich was a fashion designer and gay activist. \n Rudolph Gernreich was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1922. His father was a hosiery manufacturer and his aunt kept a dress shop in which Gernreich worked as a teenager. In 1938 with numerous other refugees, Gernreich fled to the USA and settled in California. He attended the Los Angeles City College from 1938 to 1941 and then spent a year at the Lose Angeles Art Centre School. From 1942 to 1948 he worked with a dance troupe as a dancer and costume designer. \n In 1948, he became a freelance fashion designer. He toiled for a 7th Avenue firm making copies of Paris couture garments but really hated it. In 1951, he formed a partnership with manufacturer Walter Bass to supply clothes to Jax, a Los Angeles boutique. Some years later, he opened his own company G.R. Designs Inc. which became named Rudi Gernreich Inc in 1964. \n   In the 50's he produced knitted swimwear without the usual boning and underpinning and he developed the concept into knitted tube dresses. He was awarded the prestigious Coty Award for American designers in 1960. In the early 1960s Gernreich opened a Seventh Avenue showroom in New York where he showed his popular designs for Harmon knitwear and his own more expensive line of experimental garments. During the decade he acquired a reputation for being the most radical designer in America; his designs included the jacket with one notched and one rounded lapel, tuxedos made of white satin, and the topless bathing suit of 1964, which reflected the new vogue for topless sunbathing. It was worn by Peggy Moffit, his favourite model. The \"no-bra\" bra made of moulded nylon cups attached to shoulder straps and a narrow elastic band encircling the rib cage was another of his innovations. This was cut low in front with deep armholes to be worn with deep d\u00e9collet\u00e9 evening dresses. In 1964 corset manufacturers Warner Brothers Co., commissioned Gernreich to design a bodystocking made of flesh coloured stretch nylon. He was quite creative, he did leggings, designed furniture, stockings, even gourmet soups, as well as clothing for children and menswear. Gernreich was very much ahead of his time. His boxer shorts for women predated the 80's version by about 8 years. In 1971 he had a Military look collection and showroom models carried rifles. At the time the Viet Nam war was going on. He made today's trends yesterday. He seemed to be 30 years ahead of time. In the USA, Gernreich was an influential co-founder of the Mattachine Society, the USA's first gay liberation movement. Although Mattachine's co-founder Harry Hay claimed \"never to have even heard\" of the earlier gay liberation struggle in Germany, by the people around Adolf Brand, Magnus Hirschfeld and Leontine Sagan, he is known to have talked about it with Austrian & German emigres in America. Rudi Gernreich died in 1985. In 1992, his favourite model Peggy Moffitt and her husband collaborated and published a book called \"The Rudi Gernreich Book\" detailing all the fashion ideas of Gernreich and his wonderful clothes. She explained that he was a widely misunderstood fashion prophet, who came up with all today's trends yesterday. In the year 2000, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Rudi Gernreich was one of those honoured, and here is a picture of his plaque.","the_look":"Gernreich studied dance before entering the world of fashion and, using as inspiration the practice clothes of dancers, particularly leotards and tights, he produced pared down body-clothes in the 1960s, aimed at what seemed to be the new woman of the era. To cater to this popular construction of femininity, Gernreich attempted to produce a new version of women's clothing, freed of all constraints.\nInfluenced by Bauhaus functionalism, Gernreich conceived a body-based dressing with coordinated underwear, celebrating the unfettered movement of the body based on his early involvement with Lester Horton's modern dance troupe. This interest in liberating the body from the limitations of clothing surfaced in his early swimwear designs of 1952 in which he eliminated the complicated boned and underpinned interior construction that had been obligatory in the 1950s. He revived the knitted swimsuit or \"maillot\" of the 1920s, which he elasticized to follow the shape of the body. These experiments were continued in his knitted tube dresses of 1953.\nGernreich was interested less in the details and decorations of clothes and more in how they looked in motion. In the 1950s he was designing relaxed, comfortable clothes fabricated out of wool, jersey, and other malleable materials, usually in solid colors or geometric shapes and checks. During the next decade he went on to use unusual fabrics and bold color disharmonies such as orange and blue or red and purple.\nGernreich's freeing of the breasts was a social statement, somehow part of the emancipation of women, and a portent of the unfettering of the breast by the women's movement in the 1970s. Gernreich invented the \"no bra\" bra in 1964, a soft nylon bra with no padding or boning in which breasts assumed their natural shape, rather than being molded into an aesthetic ideal.\nGernreich was also responsible for developing the concept of unisex, believing that as women achieved more freedom in the 1960s, male dress would emerge from the aesthetic exile into which it had been cast in the 19th century. He conceived interchangeable clothes for men and women such as floor-length kaftans or white knit bell-bottomed trousers and matching black and white midriff tops, and even, in 1975, Y-front underwear for women. Other designs included the first chiffon t-shirt dress, see-through blouses, coordinated outfits of dresses, handbags, hats, and stockings, mini dresses inset with clear vinyl stripes, and the thong bathing suit, cut high to expose the buttocks. He experimented constantly with the potentials of different materials using cutouts, vinyl, and plastic, and mixing patterns such as checks with dots.\nHis clothing was part of a whole design philosophy which encompassed the designing of furniture, kitchen accessories, rugs, and quilts\u2014even, in 1982, gourmet soups. His notion of freeing the body was taken to its logical extreme in his last design statement, the pubikini, which appeared in 1982, revealing the model's dyed and shaped pubic hair.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Richard Rozbora","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/richard-rozbora\/"],"biography":"The talented Slovak fashion designer Richard Rozbora was born in 1975 in Helsinki, Finland. Working in diplomatic services, his parents made it possible for him to know and, due to the long time stays, also absorb the life style and culture of a number of totally different countries. Several years spent in Mongolia, his frequent visits to China and Russia, his studies in Prague, Bratislava, Cyprus and London all added to the experience that shaped his extraordinary personality. \n After two years of architecture, interior design and urban studies at FA STU in Bratislava from 1995-1997, Richard Rozbora left with his parents for Cyprus. The flair for arts and his close relation to fashion led him to Frederick Institute of Technology in Nicosia , from1997-1998. Cyprus not only provided a new and inspiring environment for him but, as a former British colony, also the tradition of English fine tailoring. After a year in Cyprus he was admitted to the \"Harvard of fashion design\" - St.Martin's College of Art & Design in London, graduating in 2001 after completing his dissertation and his final collection. St.Martin's College is a world famous school boasting some well-known names in fashion design like John Galliano, Alexander McQueen or Stella McCartney as its graduates. \n Without any doubt the university studies were for Richard Rozbora an important step into the world of fashion. Whilst still at college he won numerous prestigious awards for his unique designs. He won the scholarship at Frederick Institute of Technology in the \"Miss Cyprus evening collection\" competition. In \"Nescaf\u00e9 Club Wear\", another competition of young designers, he was awarded a special prize in the category of \"Best Foreign Designer\". As a member of the art team and the best fashion show organizer he won the first prize in \"Laurel Award of International Students House\" in London and the second prize in \"ARTOZ paper competition\" with his paper model. The dress which brought him success was made of 720 cut out paper leaves arranged in such a way to create a plastic pattern. \n   After completing his studies the talented graduate was offered the position of a technician by the college, which was the job that Alexander McQueen had also done. Richard Rozbora worked with the hat designer Nick Smith, whose hat creations are worn by Madonna among others. He was responsible for the studio and the collection of the designer Robert Cary - Williams for Spring-Summer 2002 at London Fashion Week, he designed the outfits for the American music band Fisher Spooner for their U.S. and Great Britain tour and he was also credited with the outfits worn for the live performance by the So Solid Crew band at Brit Awards. The year 2003 brought Richard Rozbora to the Slovak fashion scene. He dressed 12 finalists of the Slovak \"Model of 2003\" and he became board member of \"TOP TREND\" competition held by the editor of M\u00f3da revue magazine in co-operation with V\u00fdstavi\u0161t\u011b Tren\u010d\u00edn - the town of fashion. In late 2003 after many successful shows abroad he presented the Haute Couture collection of exclusive evening wear under his own brand name Richard Rozbora in Bratislava, which raised his public profile greatly. The honour and appreciation of Richard Rozbora's achievements was also expressed by the British Embassy in Bratislava which invited him to participate in the campaign called \"Crossroads of Ideas\" related to the accession of Slovakia to the E.U. including \"Celebrate New Europe Party\". As an \"envoy\" in fashion he also worked on the U.K. promotion as a partner of the extended E.U. In early 2004 he started working for the famous fashion house of TAIZA as the new designer of the TAIZA Couture collection line autumn-winter 2004\/5.

With wit and daring, Fraga brought colour and fun as a counterpoint to the prevailing discrete elegance. The differences between the private and public worlds as depicted in prints on the clothes caused an immediate stir. \n Having picked up the \u201cBest Newcomer\u201d award, his regular appearances at Phytoervas Fashion eventually opened the door to Sao Paulo Fashion Week, the biggest fashion event in South America. It was here that his \u201cWho killed Zuzu Angel?\u201d collection was nominated for the Abit Prize in the best womenswear category of 2002. \n   Fraga is now considered one of the most important names in the history of fashion in Brazil. He stays true to himself instead of being a slave to trends. He appreciates comfort and subtle sensuality instead of more obvious and clich\u00e9d eroticism. And above all, he has a unique way of telling moving and unusual stories through each collection. Away from creating his collections, he teaches at universities, as well as leading workshops in which he uses fashion as the launch pad for discussing identity, creation and the means of stimulating the economy. He has designed the wardrobe for the music group Pato Fu, the production of \u201cSantagustin\u201d by the celebrated ballet company Grupo Corpo, as well as other shows by Projeto Sambalele, the social project of the Associa\u00e7ao Corpo Cidadao, which helps children, teenagers and their families living in the favelas of Belo Horizonte.","the_look":"Sewn with poetic lines, printed with a smile and put together with good music, Ronaldo Fraga\u2019s clothes reflect his time.

His mother, Dagney used to perform at the Folies Bergere at the Tropicana in Las Vegas. During Randolph Duke's growing up years, his creative mind came up with ideas on how to dress those glamourous ladies on stage. Later in life, he would translate these ideas to luxurious clothes and gowns. \n He attended the University of Nevada Las Vegas where he studied classical piano, before turning his attetnion to fashion and graduating with honors from The Fashion Institute of Design and merchandising in los Angeles. \n Duke began his career designing simple yet stylish swimwear in 1978. He then worked for Jantzen and then worked as swimwear designer for Anne Cole of California in 1982. \n   In 1984 he left Anne Cole and designed the viewpoint by Gottex swimwear line. In 1986 he opened Randolph Duke, Inc., and unveiled his first collection. Branching out into sportwear, Duke launched his first line in 1997, complete with an eponymous retail store on manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. Later, as Design Director for retailer henri Bendel, and as Creative Director for sportswear manufacturer Kenar, Duke provided his expertise in product image, marketing visual merchandising and strategic advertising. Duke has also consulted for other nationally recognized retailers, manufacturers and developers such as the rouse Company, builders of the massive \u201cFashion Show Mall\u201d in Las Vegas. In 1990 he debuted his first men's line, Duke Men and dissolved his company. The same year he signed a contract with 168, Inc. for a swimwear line. In 1991 he launched first jewelry collection. From 1993 to 1995 he reorganized sportswear line under the name Randolph Duke. In 1996 same year he began designing formal wear. In 1996, Duke achieved international recognition for his masterful resurrection of Halston, considered by many to be the most influential and iconic name in American fashion. His triumph at Halston helped establish Duke as red carpet royalty with haute couture creations that became media events. Following his stint at Halsto, Duke launched Randolph Duke, a couture evening collection. Duke progressed from swimwear to sportswear to evening wear, a progression that came naturally for a designer who has claimed that change itself is his inspiration; this particular need is what made him Hollywood's designer of choice in the late 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century. In 1998 he left Halston and opened a store in Los Angeles and successfully began creating his own line of formal eveningwear. His gowns made a bold statement in 1999, starting with a dark velvet dress with braided shoulder straps and a long slip in mohair over beaded tulle. Moving back into sportswear in 2000, Duke presented a resort collection with a selection of blouses, including one in taffeta with two drawstrings down the center that, when pulled, rose up to show the midriff.","the_look":"During his years of creating sportswear collections under his own name, Duke's designs were bold, simple, tailored in contrasting stitching, and included supple knit pieces to round out his line.

Vivier studied sculpture at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and later apprenticed at a shoe factory. It was this solid base of training in both aesthetics and technical skills that led him to become known for precision fit as well as innovative design. \n Vivier worked with some of the most innovative fashion designers, such as Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent, at the height of their careers. Schiaparelli was the first designer to include Vivier's shoes in her collections. Vivier was working for the American firm Delman at the time; Delman rejected Vivier's sketch of the shocking platform shoe which Schiaparelli included in her 1938 collection. In 1947 Vivier began to work for Christian Dior and the New Look brought new emphasis to the ankle and foot. Vivier created a number of new heel shapes for Dior, including the stiletto and the comma heel. During their ten-year association, Dior and Vivier created a golden era of design. In the 1960s Vivier created the low heeled \"pilgrim pump\" with a square silver buckle, and this shoe is often cited as fashion's most copied footwear. \n   In 1994 the 86-year-old Vivier signed a new licensing agreement with Rautureau Apple Shoes, which in turn allowed him to open a boutique in Paris the following year. The Rautureau venture gave Vivier the backing to continue doing what he loved most\u2014designing shoes. Yet three years later, in October 1998, Vivier died in Toulouse, France.

{"designer_name":"Ron Chereskin","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/ron-chereskin\/"],"biography":"It all started in 1975 with a little bit of disco and a whole lot of polyester. That was the year Ron Chereskin entered the menswear market with a line of neckwear and \"disco\" shirts based on his drawings and illustrations. Today, nearly 25 years later, Ron continues to be one of the truly distinctive voices in the world of men's fashion, as he endeavors to translate his artistic vision and talent into clothes that men can not only wear, but live in.Even before there was fashion, for Ron, there has always been art. He began his career as a freelance illustrator, quickly rising in prominence by producing award winning magazine covers, as well as commissioned paintings and illustrations. In fact, one of his illustrative works is on permanent display in the Library of the House of Representatives in Washington, D. C. \n Seeing the world through an artist's eye, Ron strongly believed that art could be infused into the most ordinary of life's functions and objects. Armed with this enlightened perspective, Ron joined forces with a number of manufacturers to apply his concept to a variety of products, including paper and home furnishings. It did not take long for retailers and consumers to take notice. As his reputation grew, he eagerly accepted an invitation to create new designs for ties. Then, of course, came the infamous \"disco\" shirts. Since then, he's never looked back. \n Ron dedicated himself to dressing men, drawing limitless amounts of inspiration from his desire to inject energy, style and comfort to the, then, staid, monotonous and overly constructed men's apparel market. Nowhere did he better marry the concepts of comfort and style then in his revolutionary cotton sweater. Retailers first balked at the idea of offering men cotton sweaters in dusty muted pastel tones, but the consumers soon vindicated Ron by making his sweaters nationwide best-sellers. For combining innovative applications of cotton fiber with beautiful textures, patterns and a breadth of color - an approach that would become Ron's trademark - he received both the Coty and Cutty. Sark awards for understanding sportswear design.","the_look":"A fashion force still is bloom. Ron continues to redefine the essence of men's sportswear by seeing color, fabric and silhouette in unique ways. As a native New Yorker, he continue to find his muse in everyday life. That is why you will find him enthusiastically browsing through flee markets, walking through parks, studying architecture, talking with local artisans and generally, absorbing the pulses and rhythms of the city life.\nAs seen through the eyes of this visionary artist and regular guy, these varied influences become the paint for his canvas - the ever day man.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

In fact, already well-known for his avant-garde style, he immediately experienced an international surge in popularity, particularly because of the jet set\u2019s immediate acceptance and enchantment with his creations. Rocco Barocco's Fashion House, providing high fashion clothing for influential people throughout the world, is located at Piazza di Spagna 81, Rome, Italy. Barocco's tastes have always leaned towards the daring and bold or over-the-top styles that are craved by so many of the rich and fashionable glitterati. During the 1980s, though still dedicated to high fashion, the designer began to work in pret-a-porter and became diversified. It was the start of second lines such as Fashion and RB, of men's suits, oversized clothes, swimwear, shirts, various leather goods, foulards, gloves, umbrellas and perfumes.","the_look":"Rocco Barocco delights in using black, black and white, and optical effects in his line of fashion wear. In fact, Rocco exults in repeating his creative patterns throughout fashion lines, creating somewhat of a defining moment for himself. Moreover, Barocco pays exceptional attention to the detailing and design of each of his creations, and this has made him deservedly famous.\nRocco Barocco's clearly defined style is creative, glamorous, and avant-garde to say the least. He attempts to challenge the fashion of the day and step beyond the expected and ordinary to create the extraordinary- something every woman deserves. He credits his style partly to his training in fashion at the hands of the very best that Rome had to offer and to the experience he has garnered from the world of high fashion.\nBarocco's designs often utilize stripes and spots. The fabrics most frequently showcased in Barocco's creations are soft and flowing, giving way to an extravagant and luxurious feel.\nBarocco fashions are often bold, bright, asymmetrical, startling, and distinctive. Fabrics and details in gold, glittering sequins and exquisite embroidering have held a constant fascination for Barocco. Moreover, Barocco prefers fine fabrics like satins, cashmeres, and crepes to create a soft, sumptuous effect with his designs. He was a major influence in the Eighties, when his use of optical illusion, and black-and-white patterns became very popular.\nHis contemporary fashions often combine the incongruous, as he chooses to pair strong styles with vibrant colors to create unforgettable fashion masterpieces. Whether his fashions are hinting at masculinity or portraying soft femininity, his styles are always perfection personified with their exquisite cuts, superlative balance, and matchless detailing. The brand epitomizes the words: rigor, humor, audacity, and poetic imagination.","who_wears_it":["Ursula Andress","Countess Claretta Agusta","Claudia Cardinale","Laura Antonelli","Liza Minelli"],"perfumes":["1987 Roccobarocco (W)","1989 Gold Jeans Cologne (M)","1991 Tre (W)","1995 Silver Jeans (W)","1997 Gold Jeans (W)","2001 Mouse (W)","2003 Mouse Cologne (M)","Fashion Man (M)","Fashion Woman (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Roccobarocco"]}

He subsequently settled in New York and worked initially in design development for fashion labels Calvin Klein and Daryl K. He then independently produced an eponymous sharply tailored denim label, which was launched in 2001 and was highly successful, as well as a line of sweatshirt apparel produced by Los Angeles fashion labels Juicy Couture and American Apparel. Gregory parlayed some of the profits from his denim label into the launch of Loomstate, an urban-cool clothing line made from organic cotton; the brand made its retail debut in 2004. Gregory subsequently forged a partnership with environmental activists Ali Hewson and her husband, Paul Hewson (also known as Bono, lead singer of the rock group U2), who were impressed by Loomstate\u2019s contemporary look and Gregory\u2019s guiding business ethic.

{"designer_name":"Rachel Fortin","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/rachel-fortin\/"],"biography":"Rachel Fortin is a Canadian fashion designer and the founder behind her own label Rachel F. \n As a young girl Rachel dreamed of being a Paris fashion designer. Because the daily traveling between Paris and Saguenay is somewhat tedious, Rachel decided to start her education by going to art classes at the Chicoutimi CEGEP. That experience stimulated Rachel\u2019s extraordinary imagination, but that young girl in her was convinced that it would be through fashion designing that she would achieve her biggest accomplishment. That\u2019s when she established herself in Montreal and entered the Marie-Victorin College in Fashion Design. Not only has that second diploma confirmed Rachel\u2019s huge passion for fashion, but also her wild talent. For that matter, the designer later won the Marc-Aurele Fortin\u2019s first prize regional contest. She was also selected to receive a bursary that honored her with an internship to the reputed Sandbjervej\u2019s SAGA INTERNATIONAL DESIGN CENTER in Denmark in order to specialize herself in the research and development of fur. Rachel Fortin\u2019s little story doesn\u2019t say if her passion for fur comes from the Nordic region of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean where she grew up, and it doesn\u2019t mention if the idea of working only with recycled leather and fur comes from the fact that she was brought up by a nice family of browns bears. \n After her first job experience in the fashion world as the assistant-designer at Mackage and as a knitwear designer at Collections MAT, Rachel knew that it\u2019s only by working on her own creation that she would truly be happy. Later, she decided to co-develop a company called DADA+TATI. For two years, Rachel presented under that signature many collections where recycled fur was already embellishing most of the clothing. Thanks to her first contribution at the Montreal\u2019s Fashion Week and at the Montreal\u2019s Arts and Crafts Fair, and also to a number of appearances in various national media publications, Rachel managed to find the energy and experience that allowed her to start her own collection. Rachel Fortin became rachel.f. \n   Rachel\u2019s sensitivity towards the environmental damages created by the modern civilization brings her to use, as the unique primary material of her creation, used animal skins and fabrics. Therefore, rachel.f. spends long hours transforming (\u201cdecapitating\u201d) your old clothes in order to give birth to a fur accessory line; toqu\u00e9e et coquette (wild an stylish), and to a leather line; trash et color\u00e9e (trash and colorful). At this moment Rachel is developing two different accessory lines. Her first 2004 fall\/winter collection was entirely created from recycled fur. She presented that first collection at the 2004 Montreal Arts and Crafts Fair where she was selected to present it to the jury. She obtained such a success that she had to lock herself in her workshop throughout the entire month of December in order to respond to the huge day by day demand. She eventually participated to the following Montreal\u2019s Arts and Crafts Fair and will be at her third year under the name of rachel.f. In the year 2005, Mariouche Gagn\u00e9, an important figure in the world of recycled fur, offered to distribute Rachel\u2019s products throughout Europe and Asia under Mariouche\u2019s line Harricana. From one collection to another, Rachel perfects her recycled fur accessory line where the extravagance and sophistication of her unique pieces has captured everyone\u2019s attention. Even the media made sure to notice her: the ICI, the Voir, La Presse, The Gazette, the Clin d\u2019Oeil, the Filles Clin d\u2019Oeil, the Shopping Clin d\u2019Oeil, the Femme Plus, the Primeurs, the Star Inc., all have presented rachel.f. in their pages. More recently, interesting reports have been dedicated to Rachel in the following television shows: Claudine (Radio-Canada), M\u00e9tamorphose (Canal Vie), and Esprit Libre (Canal Vox). Also, if rachel.f. includes many Quebec celebrities among her clients, the variety of that list shows how her creation is able to blend the extremes with much subtlety. By exploring the use of recycled leather, rachel.f. comes back with a second accessory line. She manages to bring a new life to some old leather clothes by, not only creating accessories that are completely off the wall, but also by researching the material herself. As a matter of fact, Rachel\u2019s collaborations include various visuals artists from Montreal, such as Hugo Mudie and Jason Cantoro, so that every leather piece may be attributed with silk-screened designs. This line of recycled leather accessories literally gives us the impression that the worlds of fashion and art went out for a drink and got along extremely well. The silk-screened leather that ornaments all the pieces from hats to earrings to belts and bags, they all shine with a little Montreal spark, every item in the collection is like a miniature piece of art that you carry with you at all times. rachel.f.. doesn\u2019t impose any limitation to her imagination however, two fundamental principles have established the foundation of her creation: recycling and local art production. It\u2019s by personal conviction and to preserve the integrity of her values that rachel.f. chose to use recycled material in her work. Rachel also states that using local art production brings a high quality and a human side to her collection. According to Rachel, local production is inevitable. Since the beginning, Rachel Fortin hasn\u2019t stopped pursuing her primary mission, which is to make fur more accessible by suggesting an ecological exchange solution without losing the dash of its traditional function. For that matter, if Montreal represents that city that knows how to blend paradox and originality, than the accessory line of the young designer is definitively a reflection of Montreal. With the harmonisation of recycled materials as a leitmotiv, Rachel Fortin\u2019s creations are like millions of rainbows in the far end of our alleys.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Andr\u00e9e Lachapelle","Simple Plan","Ariane Moffatt","Virginie Coossa"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Rachel F"]}

Her multi-layered drawings and dresses are beautiful palimpsests of meaning and portray a fable-like atmosphere where female figures play a central part.\nMorales is not afraid to mix different types of fabric in the same garment and her usage of feathers with lace and brocade, even if at a first glance looks whimsical, is actually the result of a careful process of cleverly draping materials. In a way, she masters fashion design in the same way that, as a painter, she commands the creative process on canvas, by layering depictions of the world as interpretations of meaning.\nMorales belongs to the realm of those confident fashion designers who are not afraid to use colour and explore shapes and textures to move fashion forward. She should be commended for creating astonishing examples of wearable creativity, for her attention to detail embodied in her exquisite materials, and for her respect for an artisanal sartorial tradition of producing beautiful ornaments.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Renata Morales"]}

His original thought was to study architecture, but he soon found that he loved the pace and aesthetics of fashion. By his third year in college, he was already creating his own ready-to-wear line at home, and selling his designs out of his Tel Aviv apartment during the weekends. \n   In 1990, right after graduating, Ronen was hired by Gideon Oberson where he worked as an assistant. His big break came in 1994 when a storefront opened up on Tel Aviv\u2019s Shenkin Street, which was then beginning to turn into the local version of Greenwich Village. In the years that followed, Ronen developed a network of retail stores in Israel. Currently, Ronen Chen has 18 retail stores in Israel and 2 retail stores in London. In 1995, Chen first exhibited his collection in London and was discovered by enthusiastic buyers and agents. Since then, he has continuously increased his international presence, with representation in showrooms throughout the United States, Canada, UK, Ireland, Holland and Australia, where he sells to over 400 independent boutiques In November 2012, Ronen Chen launched his e-commerce store in the US, finally making his entire collection available to his American customer base. As Ronen Chen continues to expand his brand, he is also dreaming of opening concept stores in the USA. \"I\u2019m looking for the right partner,\" says Chen. \"we would follow the concept we use here, which is creating intimate boutiques with a personal feel, and offering designs that are fashionable yet timeless, suited to real women's needs, and very well priced.\"","the_look":"From the very start, Chen was interested in clean, simple lines in strong, monochromatic colors. It is an instinct and signature that has remained with Chen for the last twenty years. \nRonen Chen proposes a stylish and minimalist label in monochromatic colors, inspired by his love for architecture. His clothing always falls marvelously on any type of silhouette. A true artist, he prefers to begin garment design by first draping fabrics on a mannequin and then to let himself be driven by the fabric, rather than to sketch the design on paper. The result is creations that mould easily to any shape. \n\u201cI take a piece of fabric and i start to drape it on the same mannequin that I\u2019ve been using for the last 20 years,\u201d he says, calling the mannequin his \u201csecret\u201d for its perfect proportions. \u201cIt\u2019s clothing that\u2019s understood and because it\u2019s draped, with very few seams, it\u2019s comfortable and that\u2019s what my customers love.\u201d","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

At the age of 17, she was employed to dress the window displays in a Parisian textile store. \n Sonia was married to the owner of a boutique which sold elegant clothing, but in 1962 she just couldn't find any soft sweaters to wear when she was pregnant. So she used a supplier to her husband from Venice, to design her own. The sweater went back 7 times for alterations before she was satisfied with it. This first creation was called the Poorboy Sweater, and she started selling it from her husbands label \"Laura. It made the cover of Elle fashion magazine, and brought her fame. She later became the first designer to put seams on the outside of a garment, and to print words on her sweaters. \n   In 1968, she opened her first boutique. Rykiel has written many books, including an A to Z of fashion, and a collection of children\u2019s stories. In 1980 she was voted one of the world's 10 most elegant women. In October 2001, she showed her Spring 2002 collection at the Louvre in Paris, proving that nothing has changed in almost 40 years she has been designing. Her slim fitted sweaters, her love for scrawling random words across a chest or down an arm endures, as does her signature stripes. Even though she is in her 70's, Sonia is no prude.

Her Lurex knitwear is sophisticated enough for evening. The Americans call her the \"Queen of Knitwear\". She is the one who encouraged Robert Altman to make his ready-to-wear film \"Pret-a-Porter.

Early in his career, he was noted for his adventurous approach to clothing design and construction. He created garments in leather, notably a nail-studded black jacket and patchwork trousers. He was awarded the prestigious Coty Fashion Award in 1973, and again in 1974. In all he collected 3 Coty Awards during his career. Also in 1973, Burrows took part in the legendary Franco-American fashion extravaganza at the Palace of Versailles in France alongside Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass and Yves St. Laurent. There has been a gap when Burrows was not in the headlines. He did not stop designing clothes, but had a special made-to-order and bridal business. For a while he moved to New Jersey to take care of his brother who died of AIDS. In March 2002, the 59 year old 3-time Coty Award winner, opened a new boutique in New York. In the year 2000\/2002, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along the pavement of 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Stephen Burrows was one of those honoured. Last year Henri Bendel relaunched Burrows with a brand new in-store atelier.

After his clothes sold successfully at O, a NYC gallery-boutique located across from Max\u2019s Kansas City, Henri Bendel's created an atelier in the basement of their store called \"Stephen Burrows' World.\" But in 1982, Bendel's was sold, and Burrows' fame and fortune went with it. In 2002, after 20 years of obscurity, he made one of the biggest comebacks in fashion history with a re-vamped Bendel\u2019s boutique and, later, Fashion Week shows.

{"designer_name":"Salvatore Ferragamo","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/salvatore-ferragamo\/"],"biography":"  Salvatore Ferragamo was born in 1898 in Bonito, near Naples, Italy.. He was one of the most influential footwear designers of the 20th century, providing Hollywood's glitterati with unique hand-made designs and spawning an emporium of luxury consumer goods for men and women, with stores in some of the most important cities of the world. \n After making his first pair of shoes at age nine, for her sister to wear on her confirmation, young Salvatore decided that he had found his calling. After studying shoemaking in Naples for a year, Ferragamo opened a small store based in his parent's home. \n   In 1914, Salvatore emigrated to Boston, where one of his brothers worked in a cowboy boot factory. After a brief stint at the factory, Salvatore convinced his brothers to move to California, first Santa Barbara then Hollywood. It was here that Ferragamo found success, initially opening a shop for repair and made-to-measure shoes, which soon became prized items among celebrities of the day, leading to a long period of designing footwear for the cinema. For more than 30 years he shod the whole galaxy, from Lillian Gish in the first silent films to Marilyn Monroe in the Seven Year Itch. Greta Garbo purchased 70 pairs of shoes in one visit to the shop in Florence. One of his most celebrated pieces are Dorothy's ruby slippers for the 1939 version of The Wizard of Oz. After spending thirteen years in the United States, Ferragamo returned to Italy in 1927, this time settling in Florence. In 1929 Ferragamo opened a workshop in the Via Manelli, concentrating his efforts in experimenting with design, applying for patents for ornamental and utility models and some related invetions. Forced to file for bankruptcy in 1933 due to bad management and economic pressures, Ferragamo nonetheless expanded his operation during the 1950 to a workforce of around 700 expert artisans that produced 350 pairs of hand-made shoes a day. By 1936, he was using materials other than leather, such as needlepoint, lace, hemp, cellophane, raffia, cork - he even tried fishskin. Left above is the 1947 \"Invisible\" shoe made with nylon thread and on the right is the 1938 sandal with gold kid straps and platform sole. In 1949, he married Wanda Milleti and they had 6 children, Flamma, Giovanna, Ferrucio, Fulvia, Leonardo and Massimo. They followed in their father's footsteps and today the house of Ferragamo is bigger than Salvatore could ever imagine. In 1952 Salvatore got the idea that his heels would last longer if made of steel, and so he fitted some to try out. They were a great success and he called them by the Italian name Stiletto. Ferragamo was always recognized as a visionary, and his designs ranged from the strikingly bizarre objet d'art to the traditionally elegant, often serving as the main inspiration to other footwear designers of his time and beyond. Salvatore Ferragamo died in 1960 at the age of 62, but his name lives on as an international company, which has expanded its operations to include luxury shoes, bags, eyewear, silk accesories, watches, perfumes and a ready to wear clothing line. Today, his two sons, James and Salvatore, run the Ferragamo company. The Salvatore Ferragamo Museum was opened in 1995 at the second floor of the Palazzo Spini Feroni in Florence, Italy, to display part of the collection of revolutionary designs by Ferragamo. Leonardo was only 7 when his father died but when he was 14 he made a pair of shoes for his mother by hand. the label The Ferragamo house is a family concern. Mother Wanda keeps an overall eye on everything. The three sons of Salvatore all take care of different activities. Massimo, the youngest looks after the United States from New York. Leonardo Ferragamo, from the Italian headquarters, has moved the overall concern also into fashion design, and supplies exquisite garments world-wide. Ferragamo is also known for printed scarves, soft cashmere shawls and elegant jewellery. They are now a million dollar concern. Leonardo Ferragamo continues to design, as also his sister Fiamma. Giovanna presides over the ready-to-wear production in Milan, Fulvia looks after silk accessories and has also recently added jewellery. They have broadened their product line to include ready-to-wear clothing that is simple but luxurious and also soft leather garments. Mens wear is another line. Salvatore's grand-daughter Vivia (daughter ofFerrucio Ferragamo CEO of Ferragamo, Italy) set up her own London-based label in September 2002 for womenswear. She presented her first catwalk show during the London Fashion Week of February 2003. She has a very feminine, young, fresh look and hopes to be successful. She had spent 3 years learning about design at Emanuel Ungaro which she says was a very positive experience. Marc Audibet joined the Ferragamo Italy design team for the company in 2000. He left after presenting collections for 4 seasons. Nicole Fischelis, former fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue store in New York, is also part of the design team. In April 2002, Scottish designer Graeme Black joined Ferragamo as chief designer.

{"designer_name":"Stella McCartney","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/stella-mccartney\/"],"biography":"  Stella McCartney was born on September 13, 1971, the daughter of Paul McCartney, member of the Beatles singing group. She is a British fashion designer. Stella has always been fascinated by fashion. As a teenager, she was always mixing up bits and pieces for antique clothing markets with Cerruti or Lacoste, or whatever she could find in her mother's cupboards. \n At the age of 13, Stella constructed her first jacket. At 15, she was apprenticing at Christian Lacroix and soon after was awarded a place at St. Martins. She was almost instantly successful, with her graduation collection being sported at the graduation show by supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell. The show made front-page news, and the entire collecton was sold to Tokio, a London boutique. After graduating from Central St. Martins, London, she did a short, unofficial, apprenticeship with Edward Sexton, a Savile Row tailor. \n   In 1997 McCartney was appointed chief designer at Paris fashion house Chloe, following in the footsteps of Karl Lagerfeld. She started with the Autumn\/Winter 1997 collection, and has been an astounding success. A Chloe boutique has opened in London, though it is hoped that Stella can have more control on the London end than she does on the Paris end. The rather elderly staff at Paris Chloe are pretty rigid about underclothes on the models, and see-through dresses (they are against them). Stella McCartney is a strict vegetarian and PETA supporter like her mother Linda, who died in 2000. She had a contract with Chloe that she need never work with fur or leather. All the shoes are made of vinyl or plastics, all the bags and belts of fabric or raffia. Her soft romantic clothes have been very successful at Chloe. For the Spring 2000 collection, she has created several designs with cut-work rhinestone necklines and bodices. In the year 2000, Stella McCartney was approached by Tom Ford of Gucci, with an offer of financial support so that she could set up her own label. She agreed to this, and left Chloe. Her assistant at Chloe, Phoebe Philo, took over the designing at Chloe. Stella was looking for an artist to illustrate her new venture. She saw a 1972 sketch made by British artist David Remfry, and after seeing his work, decided that he was the one. In 2002 Remfry prepared the McCartnery adverts which appeared in all the leading fashion magazines. The sketches were so eye-catching and sexy that they blew the whole industry away. In August 2003, Stella married her long-time love publisher Alasdhair Willis. The setting was a castle on the island of Bute, in the river Clyde, in Scotland, loaned to them by the Marquis of Bute (racing driver Johnny Dumfries). Stella's father, former Beatle Paul McCartney paid around 2 million pounds, as father of the bride. Stella designed her own wedding gown, using as inspiration the one worn by her mother when she married in 1969. In February 2005, the couple had a baby boy just before Stella will be presenting her Fall\/Winter 2005 collection in Paris. They have called him Miller Alisdhair James Willis. Stella took time out from preparations for her Spring\/Summer 2004 collection in Paris, to fly over to the United States for the opening of her new Los Angeles store. In September 2004, it was announced that Stella has formed a collaboration with Adidas to design a new collection of stylish, high-tech gym wear after working with experts for ideas for runners, swimmers and athletes. High Street fashion giant H&M announced in May 2005 that Stella McCartney would design a 40 piece collection for them in the Autumn. They find her designs modern, cool, classic and wearable. In September H & M started selling the McCartney range, with great success. She has selected one or two things from her own label collections, but of course the cost is much lower in the High Street. This should lead to Stella's clothes finding a much wider market. Margareta van den Bosch, head of design at H & M said that the company was thrilled to collaborate with Stella. the label Stella launched her new house with the Spring 2002 collection, presenting clothes emblazoned with rhyming Cockney slang, that had the punchy tang of a hit from the word go. She got her label off to a snappy start in front of Domenico de Sole, the boss of the Gucci group, and McCartney's partner. Her brand new 4000 sq ft store in Manhattan opened in September 2002, housing her ready-to-wear, shoe and accessories collections. It has an inlaid pool running the length of the store and walls of hand-painted fabric. There was a fabulous party to celebrate the opening. The financial results for Stella's new company for the first year of operation, were not very good. It suffered losses of 2.7 million pounds. However GUCCI, who own her label, have absolute faith in her and said that they have high hopes for her future. In late November, Stella's owners GUCCI appointed a new CEO for Stella McCartney. He is Marco Bizzari (born 1962) a well-experienced financial and managerial man. He is expected to push the profits up even higher.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Annie Lennox","Gwyneth Paltrow","Pamela Anderson"],"perfumes":["2003 Stella (W)","2006 Stella In Two (W)"],"social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/stellamccartney","brands":["Stella Mccartney","Adidas By Stella Mccartney","Stella Mccartney Eyewear"]}

{"designer_name":"Sir Cecil Beaton","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/sir-cecil-beaton\/"],"biography":"Sir Cecil Walter Hardy Beaton was an English fashion and portrait photographer and a stage and costume designer for films and the theatre. \n Cecil Beaton was born in London, England on 14th January, 1904, to a society family. He was educated at Heath Mount School and joined St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1922 but left in 1925 without graduating. \n When Beaton was growing up his Nanny had a Kodak 3A Camera, a popular model which was renowned for being an ideal piece of equipment to learn on. Beaton's nanny began teaching him the basics of photography and developing them in his basement. He would often get his sisters and mother to sit for him. When he was sufficiently proficient, he would send the photos off to London society magazines, often writing under a pen name and \u2018recommending\u2019 the work of Beaton. \n   Beaton designed book jackets and costumes for charity matinees, learning the professional craft of photography at the studio of Paul Tanqueray, until Vogue took him on regularly in 1927. In the 20's, Beaton was something of a star illustrator in British Vogue, but his contribution would soon swing heavily over to photography. In 1924 he also set up his own studio in London, and one of his earliest clients and, later, best friends was Stephen Tennant; Beaton's photographs of Tennant and his circle are considered some of the best representations of the \"Bright Young Things\" of the twenties and thirties. By 1927 his portraits of young ladies showed why they were called the flappers. The friendship and patronage of the Sitwell family introduced him into artistic and avant-garde circles. His photographs and designs for theatre sets soon led to commissions. When he sailed for New York in 1929, he was already a successful society and fashion photographer. He was already taking photographs for the British edition of Vogue in 1931 when George Hoyningen-Huene, who was a photographer for the French Vogue traveled to England with his new friend Horst. Horst himself would begin to work for French Vogue in November of that year. The exchange and cross pollination of ideas between this collegial circle of artists across the Channel and the Atlantic gave rise to the look of style and sophistication for which the 1930s are known. Beaton is best known for his fashion photographs and society portraits. He worked as a staff photographer for Vanity Fair and Vogue in addition to photographing celebrities in Hollywood. He used every possible expressive form. Normally Vogue readers would not be interested in such people, but when drawn by Cecil, the sketch was worthwhile looking at. In 1934, he drew the Hon. Blanche Arundell and her spotted dog, for Vogue. She was wearing the latest mode. He was a mischievous observer of the beau monde between the two World Wars. In the same year, he travelled to Paris for Vogue, contributing sketches of gowns made by Elsa Schiaparelli and the house of Worth. In the mid 1930's, Beaton moved to Hollywood where he took portraits of actresses and designed scenery and costumes for the theatre and films. He was a prolific illustrator, contributing to numerous magazines in England and the USA. He published several books of observations on fashion and fashionable people, some of which were illustrated with photographic studies and caricatures. After the war, Beaton tackled the Broadway stage, designing sets, costumes, and lighting for a 1946 revival of Lady Windermere's Fan, in which he also acted. His most lauded achievement for the stage was the sets and costumes for Lerner and Loewe's My Fair Lady (1956), which led to two Lerner and Loewe film musicals, Gigi (1958) and My Fair Lady (1964), both of which earned Beaton the Academy Award for Costume Design. Additional Broadway credits include The Grass Harp (1952), The Chalk Garden (1955), Saratoga (1959), Tenderloin (1960), and Coco (1969). He is the winner of four Tony Awards. Beaton had a major influence on and relationship with two other leading lights in British photography, that of Angus McBean and David Bailey. McBean was arguably the best portrait photographer of his era \u2014 in the second part of McBeans career (post war) his work is clearly heavily influenced by Beaton, though arguably McBean was technically far more proficient in his execution. Bailey was also enormously influenced by Beaton when they met whilst working for British Vogue in the early 1960s, Bailey's stark use of square format (6x6) images bears clear connections to Beatons own working patterns. In 1972, he received his knighthood, but suffered a major stroke two years later. It took several months of recovery before he realized one side of his body would be permanently paralyzed. Although he learnt to write and draw with his left hand, as well as having all his cameras adapted, Beaton became frustrated by the new limitations the stroke had put upon his work. As a result of his stroke, Beaton became anxious about financial security for his old age and, in 1976, entered into negotiations with Philippe Garner, expert-in-charge of photographs at Sotheby's. On behalf of the auction house, Garner acquired Beaton's archive \u2014 excluding all portraits of the Royal Family, and the five decades of prints held by Vogue in London, Paris and New York. Garner, who had almost singlehandedly invented the photographic auction, oversaw the archive's preservation and partial dispersal, so that Beaton's only tangible assets, and what he considered his life's work, would ensure him an annual income. The first of five auctions was held in 1977, the last in 1980. By the end of the 1970s, Beaton's health had faded to that of an old man. In January 1980, he died during the night at his grand home in Broad Chalke in Wiltshire. Though primarily homosexual \u2014 the great love of his life was the wealthy art collector Peter Watson \u2014 he did have relationships with women, including the actress Greta Garbo and socialite Doris Castlerosse. He claimed that his heterosexual virginity was taken by American socialite Marjorie Oelrichs. Beaton also claimed to have had an affair with the American actor Gary Cooper, who was a close friend of his for many years.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

Her husband was hot-tempered and financially irresponsible, and for nearly 30 years Sonia propped him up till he died in 1938. \n They were living in Madrid when the Russian revolution took place, and her rich St. Petersberg relatives stopped supporting her. Diaghilev happened to be in Madrid looking for a set designer for his ballet \"Cleopatre\" and Sonia found her true calling when she designed it for him. Her vibrant geometrics and glowing concentric circles later adorned vases, hatboxes, fabrics and even a car. \n She painted bold, abstract canvases dominated by curves, triangles and squares. In 1925, she worked with the textile company Bianchini-Ferier and created printed geometric designs in contrasting colours. In the same year, she produced patchwork designs which were made into coats by Jacques Heim. \n   Her influence can be noted in the work of Jean Patou, Elsa Schiaparelli and other designers of the 20's and 30's. She used brilliantly coloured and sharply patterned geometric designs on the 'simultaneous' coat worn by Gloria Swanson in 1923.

He graduated in 1979 from St. Martin's School of Art in London. When Stephen Jones left St. Martin's School of Art in London in 1979, hats were yet to become high fashion news for the young. Ethnic styles had spread from the mid-1970s onward, drably cloaking the fashion-buying public with serious good taste and leaving little room for wit or fantasy. \n He started off well. In 1979 he designed a hat collection for Fiorucci. \n He then joined the eminent French house of Lachasse briefly before opening his own business in 1980. Jone's often asymmetric and outrageous hats quickly became popular with designers such as Jean-Paul Gaultier, Claude Montana, Thierry Mugler and Zandra Rhodes. \n   In 1984, Jones became the first British milliner to work in Paris where he created hats for Jean-Paul Gaultier. Since that time he has designed for the collections of Antonio Berardi, John Galliano, Katherine Hamnett, Emanuel Ungaro and Vivienne Westwood, among others. He makes innovative and witty hats, boaters, caps and bowlers, even miniature top hats as shown here in 1988. Jones' work is imaginative and in the early 80's his hats appeared in several pop videos. Diana, Princess of Wales, decided to branch out from the traditional royal milliners and often turned to Jones for her hats. He is credited with helping to revive millinery arts during the latter part of the 20th century, and he is still going strong. In 1990 he launched a number of new accessory and diffusion lines. He has named them MISS JONES, JONES BOY and JONES GIRL. Jones created some memorable hats for Antonio Berardi's Spring 2002 collection. One was made up of 5 little white bowler top hats threaded on a wire. Berardi seems to be one of Stephen's favourites. John Galliano used Stephen Jones tiaras and crowns for his regal Haute Couture Fall 2004 collection, which were really stunning. Stephen is called on by many leading designers who need hats to show their clothes off to best advantage. His hats have been used in the Spring\/Summer 2005 collections of John Galliano for Christian Dior, Emanuel Ungaro, Ghost and Antonio Berardi. The wedding of the year was in Paris, when Bernard Arnault's daughter Delphine married Alessandro Gancia. The gowns were made by John Galliano, but the hats were mostly made by Stephen Jones including the bridal veil. The maid-of-honour wore a champagne coloured wide brimmed hat with her Dior suit while the Bride's mother wore a lavender lacy hat.","the_look":"Jones was a champion of the eccentric, the stylish, and the innovative.

An enthusiastic self-publicist, his charm and good humor endeared him to many.\nJones' salons\u2014the first in Covent Garden's P.X.\u2014were unique environments, swathed in lush fabric and dripping with gilt cupids, where one might gaze leisurely at his always astonishing and delightful creations. He reinterpreted the chic and quirky styles of the past, cleverly draping, molding, and trimming his hats in a way so personal as to be entirely of its own time.

In 1983, with a loan from his family, he launched his first collection. \n In the 1980's Stephen Sprouse halped pave the way for a 60's renaissance, designing such nostalgic fashions as this neon pink, Nehru-collared reversible coat of 1985, shown over his black silk jersey sleeveless T-shirt and short wool gabardine skirt. \n   In 1988 he closed his business but he re-opened in 1997, and used Andy Warhol's prints on his dresses. Sprouse had the exclusive rights to use the famous Pop Art images in clothing designs. This 1998 outfit is called 'partytime' and has Day-Glo graffiti sprayed onto the outfit. In the year 2000, Sprouse was again in the news. He decorated the Louis Vuitton showroom with his signature graffiti prints, and collaborated with them on a handbag covered with a graffiti print.

{"designer_name":"Sybil Connolly","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/sybil-connolly\/"],"biography":"Sybil Connolly was born in 1921 in Wales but her father was from Ireland. In 1938, she served an apprenticeship with Bradleys, the dressmakers in Connolly began her fashion apprenticeship while in her teens, going to work for a London dressmaker to study dress design. Her most notable experience during her two-year tenure there was holding pins for Queen Mary's fittings at Buckingham Palace and noting the immense care being taken to design dresses that softened and complemented the dowager Queen's advanced age. Her apprenticeship at Bradley's was cut short by the outbreak of war, and she returned to Ireland. In 1940, she continued her apprenticeship at Richard Alan, which was at the time Dublin's premiere fashion house. At the age of 22, Connolly became director at Richard Alan and proceeded to build the store's couture department. In 1950 she designed a small collection that sold quite well, and her career as a designer began. \n In 1953 when Ireland staged it's first international dress show, Sybil Connolly was the star. \n Connolly became extremely successful and well-known in Ireland, the USA and later also in Australia and promoted the use of Irish linen, wool, tweed and lace. She appeared on the cover of LIFE magazine, dressed a series of aristocratic figures and became a friend of Jacqueline Kennedy. When Jacqueline Kennedy visited Ireland in July 1967, she visited Connolly and wore one of her linen dresses in an official White House portrait. \n   In 1957, she parted with Richard Alan and established her own fashion house. She attracted a great deal of attention with her method of hand-pleating fine linen which she made up into delicate blouses and dresses. She also developed an international reputation as an interior designer and designed crystal and pottery for Tiffany and Company. In her latter years, she catered only for a small group of loyal clients. She also spent her retirement years on writing books on Irish crafts, homes and gardens. She died in 1998 at the age of 77.","the_look":"She specialized in adapting traditional textiles such as Irish crochet, Carrickmacross lace and Donegal tweeds, into fashion garments. \nThroughout the 50's and 60's, Connolly helped popularize handwoven woolens, tweeds and mohairs into fashion fabrics. \nConnolly's design philosophy was in keeping with that of Hubert de Givenchy, whose work was a source of inspiration for her. Elegance without sacrificing comfort, the finest craftsmanship, and attention to detail were the hallmarks of her work. She felt that a dress should show a woman's curves, saying, \"I must see movement in a dress. A woman's body is inside. It breathes. It moves.\" Her other major sources of inspiration were nature and the traditional fabrics and everyday clothing of the Irish. Working in Donegal tweeds, Eliot's poplin, Carrickmacross lace, bainin (a thin, handwoven wool) and Irish linen, she created collections based on the simple slim lines of riding habits, and utilized the hooded cloaks, scarlet flannel petticoats, crocheted blouses, and black Connemars shawls of Irish traditional dress. She also designed evening dresses with ruffled tops, a coming-out gown made entirely of men's linen handkerchiefs, and handkerchief linen nightgowns embroidered with flowers and hand-sewn with tiny tucks, which were a favorite of Jacqueline Kennedy's.\nThroughout her career, Connolly sought out and utilized the traditional crafts and artistry of her native land: Donegal embroidery, handwoven lace, and iridescent Donegal tweeds. She commissioned the nuns of Clones Convent to make lace for her and found inspiration in the simple lines of a Carmelite nun's habit. Connolly brought echoes of Irish daily life into vogue among the best dressed of the rich and famous. Indeed, Connolly was herself often included on American best-dressed lists.\nThe invention of a unique linen fabric is considered one of Connolly's greatest achievements. Using nine yards of handkerchief linen backed by taffeta to make one yard of hand-pleated dress material, she created an uncreasable, uncrushable linen, which she then custom-dyed in rich colors and fitted into lovely ball gowns. The gowns were so resistant to the ravishments of time that they were an investment lasting generations, handed down from mother to daughter to granddaughter. Jacqueline Kennedy wore a skirt of Connolly's pleated linen when she was painted by Aaron Shickler for a portrait that hangs in the White House.\nThroughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Connolly enjoyed popularity on both sides of the Atlantic. In the 1970s she continued to bring small collections to New York. She would show them at the Fifth Avenue apartment of a friend, gather orders for custom designs, and take them back to be made up in her Dublin workshops. But the trends of fashion in those years were not to her taste, and she had no interest in following them. She was known to comment that she couldn't understand why the young people of the time were so set on making themselves look \"awful.\" The skirts were too short, the lines were not right, and trousers were \"only for riding.\"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

Albou was born in 1967 just a few years after her mother had emigrated to France from Tunisia. Albou's father, Yvan, was also of North African heritage, and she and her older brother, Serge, grew up in Paris. \n Albou's parents launched a shirtmaking company called Julien in 1976, and it was thriving by the time the family vacationed in New York City in 1982. There, Albou's mother, Nicole, was struck by the use of a French word, \"garage,\" because in France such public-parking structures were called \"parkings.\" Inspired by the arty New York new-wave scene, Nicole began designing a new line of shirts for an offshoot label they dubbed Le Garage, and its sales soon eclipsed that of Julien. Albou was soon assisting her mother in the design atelier as the venture took off, and the family opened the first of several Le Garage boutiques in Paris in 1987. \n Albou was educated at the Sorbonne and the Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode before going to work for the clothing company Azzedine Alaia in 1983. \n   Married and a mother by that point, Albou named her new company after her two young sons, Paul and Joe. Her parents provided the initial financial backing, while her husband, Franck, joined the company management team as well. Albou started with a menswear collection, but it was her women's line, launched in 1996, that quickly proved a hit. Top retailers, such as Barneys New York and Fred Segal in Los Angeles, began carrying it, and within a few years her small Paris boutiques were a well-known secret among the fashion set as a place where unpredictable yet appealing designs could be found along with carefully culled vintage items. Albou followed with boutiques in London's Notting Hill neighborhood, and one in New York City, on Bond Street, which opened in 2001. Two years later, she launched a cosmetics line, followed by lingerie and accessories. Her international appeal made her an easy choice for the U.S. mass retailer Target, which invited her to become the third de-signer in its \"Go International\" series in 2006 for its juniors' apparel department.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Sophie Marceau"],"perfumes":["2003 Blanc (W)","2003 Bleu (W)"],"social_media":"","brands":["Paul Et Joe","Paul Et Joe Sister"]}

Some basic elements of his fashion were probably inspired by Laurent: the oblique cut, the frills falling down in a certain way, his love for geometric patterns. \n In Paris he studied at Saint Roch's School of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture. He then worked for some French clothing brands and, for some time, for Kenzo. \n   In 1980 he moved to New York, invited by Diane F\u00fcrstenberg, who entrusted him with the direction of all the licenses of her clothing line and, later, of her couture Collection.

The root of his work is his passion for tattoos: He has been cultivating it since he was young. In fact, when he was 17, he got his shoulder tattooed with an eagle by one of Italian\u2019s pioneer of this art, Maurizio Fiorini. After this \u201cinitiation rite\u201d he started going more and more often to Maurizio\u2019s shop, which was horrible compared to today\u2019s tattoo shops. \n Quite obviously, he got interested in holding a tattoo machine shortly after, but he soon realized he didn\u2019t have much feeling with it. Luckily enough, though, his 20 year experience as a goldsmith let him find another way to stay within the tattoo world. Fifteen years ago he made his first jewels, and since then his production has always increased, so the job he used to consider as a sideline one has soon become his principal one. But what actually marked his presence in the tattoo world are ex-voto compositions. For years now he has been travelling around the world to explain the meaning of ex votos, telling this tradition typical of neo-Latin countries. The idea for these works comes from his passion for religious icons and antiques: he has always been fascinated by them because he grew up in Arezzo, home of one of Italy\u2019s most importants antiques fair. \n His approach to religious elements changed in 2006, when he took part to an exhibition of skateboards in Paris. After that experience he started customizing skateboards, snowboards, surfboards and recently musical instruments, too. He usually drills the board using it as a frame; then, he mounts several antiques in its hollow and he decorates the outer part. \n   He has got many interests beyond that, and this way he has started making compositions that are given as award to the best tattoo artists at tattoo conventions\u2019competitions. He actually makes awards for Tattoo Conventions in Milan, Rome, Trieste, London, Long Beach, Sacramento. In the last 5 years he has opened up his working horizons to the field of art. He took part to exhibitions in several art galleries, such as Spazio in mostra in Milan, Antonio Colombo arte contemporanea gallery in Milan, MF galery in NYC-Genoa, Mondo pop in Rome. Both his job as a goldsmith and his artist activity are made even more appealing to him by collaborations with close friends and talented artists. As a goldsmith, he always has Massimo Bennati working alongside him, while to make works of art he has been working with Massimo Gurnari, Vanni Cuoghi, Laura Giardino, Danilo Pasquali, Massimo Giacon and many more.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["El Rana"]}

At an early age, he developed a love for nature and soon learned how he could incorporate it into design. Stephens formal training began at the School of Visual Arts in New York City where he was a student of sculpture and painting. He began fusing his two loves, which led to designing hand carved stone bangles; this was his first venture into the jewelry design world. \n Stephen launched his first line at Bergdorf Goodman in May of 1981 and was an immediate success. Soon after his first collection was launched, Geoffrey Beene saw his work and asked him if he could spotlight his collection on the runway, exposing Stephen to the powerful synergy between accessories and fashion. Over the years he has had many collaborations with other influential designers including Donna Karan, Oscar de la Renta, Catherine Malandrino, and Escada. In his new niche of artistic fashion jewelry, he took the press by storm. This has led to many years of editorial success featured in the industrys leading magazines: Vogue, In-Style, Harpers Bazaar, W, Town & Country, and Robb Report. \n Stephen has long drawn his inspiration from the wealth of materials found in nature. He collects stones from all over the world tourmalines from Brazil, boulder opals from Australia, ammonites from Morocco, and pearls from the South Sea. In the past 24 years, he has created an extensive gallery of stones and minerals, from which his One of a Kind pieces are born. Each of the OAKS is adorned with his signature beetle,ADAM. A One of a Kind piece can never be duplicated, due to each natural mineral being very distinct from one another. The avid Stephen Dweck collector acquires pieces from the Signature Collection. These are rare OAK pieces that are comprised of very unique materials, set in 18kt gold. This collection is the most coveted of all of Stephens works of art; culminating his status as romancer of the stones. \n   His jewelry is on permanent display in the Costume Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Smithsonian Institute Fashion Archives in Washington, D.C. Currently in the Dallas Museum of Art, Stephen has a sterling silver serving set on display in a traveling exhibition called Modernism in American silver. Designing this set of serving pieces for the home has allowed Stephen to venture into one of his other passions of designing; a home collection. A trip to the Stephen Dweck showroom in Manhattan will illustrate that this prolific designer has not limited himself to just jewelry. His works include a range of ladies and mens belts, mens jewelry, a home collection including fine china, his expertly crafted sterling silver serving collection, and flawlessly renovated furniture.

Nicky, who had wanted to be a fashion designer from childhood, started the business single-handedly after working for just six months with a swimwear designer. She is the creative force who has overall design control and shapes the label's market positioning.

{"designer_name":"Scott Morrison","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/scott-morrison\/"],"biography":"Earnest Sewn's Designer and President, Scott Morrison, was born and raised in Palm Springs, California. Morrison spent his collegiate years attending the University of Washington-Seattle while on an atheletic scholarship for golf. Through golf, he developed an interest in the clothing industry, and after a brief stint playing golf professionally, he committed himself to learning the apparel business from the ground up, and took a full time position working for Seattle based designer, Derek Andrew. \n In 1998, at the age of 25, Scott was hired to oversee a new denim division of Mudd Jeans, based in NYC. Jack Jeans, as it would be known, struggles to find its place in the better jeans market, and in an attempt to bring the failing concept to life, Scott developed a new idea for an American made denim collection that would compete with the likes of Diesel and Replay. His vision was realized in 1999 when the Jack jeans division was closed, and the company instead chose to invest in Morrison's new concept: Paper Denim & Cloth. Over the next 4 years at Paper Denim, Scott's reputation in the industry grew. As co-founder and designer of Paper Denim & Cloth, he quickly established the growing operation as one of the world's preeminent denim brands. Inspired by that growth he began incorporating other areas of personal and cultural interest into the budding lifestyle concept. One example was infusing artist collaborations and Limited Edition projects within the Paper Denim aesthetic. The result was one of the first of its kind, and provided an unparalleled medium for talented artists, such as Faile and Bast, to explore their concepts on clothing and gain worldwide exposure in the process. Morrison also published, personally, a limited Edition retrospective of emerging underground artists, in a book called Boredom 2003 which further fused his 2 great loves, underground art and innovative design. \n After almost 5 years at one of the first American success stories in the premium denim market, Morrison has stepped out on his own. His new creation is a dual fold design concept called \"Earnest Sewn\" and \"An Earnest Cut & Sew\". Both brands are built on his obsession for quality, uniqueness, and the innovative fusion of 2 diverse vintage aesthetics. \n   The focal point of the new Earnest Sewn collections are an appreciation for denim's Americana past coupled with the Japanese aesthetic system of Wabi-sabi, which contends that perfection is found in the imperfect. These 2 themes are represented throughout the Earnest Sewn collections and incorporated into Morrison's classically understated designs and overt attention to detail. Earnest Sewn will undoubtedly become a modern day testament to beauty, tradition, and the ever present influence of denim in our continually evolving world culture. Scott Morrison, now 32, resides in Woodstock, NY and NYC. Although he'd enjoy spending more time creating and designing furniture in his upstate woodshop, or fly-fishing on the Esopus Creek, he can be found most days, and most nights, overseeing the Earnest operations and designing its men's and women's collections from Earnest's offices in Meat Packing District in NYC.

This fabric was not only water-resistant but also extremely durable. A patent was taken out in 1888. In 1891, Burberry established a wholesale business in London.

{"designer_name":"Tomford","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/tomford\/"],"biography":"  Tom Ford was born on August 27, 1961. He is an American fashion designer and is considered one of the most famous and influential designer ever. He gained international fame for his legendary turnaround of the Gucci fashion house and the creation of the Tom Ford label, becoming one of the world's most influential designers. \n Ford was born in Austin, TX and gresw up in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His mother was a colourful Southern lady who had 6 husbands and a cupboard full of Courreges suits. She taught him that being badly dressed was disrespectful of others. He spent most of his childhood worrying about how he looked. \n   In New Mexico he graduated from Santa Fe Preparatory School in 1970. After studying at NYU and then Parsons School of Design in 1986, initially having studied architecture, he took design jobs with Cathy Hardwick and Perry Ellis under designer Marc Jacobs. In 1990, Ford was hired by Gucci's then creative director Dawn Mello as chief women's ready-to-wear designer, and later appointed design director. When, in 1994, Gucci was acquired by a Bahrain-based investment firm called Investcorp, Ford was promoted to creative director and moved to Milan with his partner, journalist Richard Buckley. In his first year at the helm, he was credited with putting the glamour back into fashion introducing Halston-style velvet hipsters, skinny satin shirts and car-finish metallic patent boots. In 1995, he brought in French stylist Carine Roitfeld and photographer Mario Testino to create a series of new, modern ad campaigns for the company. By 1999, the house, which had been almost bankrupt when Ford joined, was valued at about $4.3 billion. Further in his first year at Gucci, the profits soared and Tom Ford was called a genius. He overseas womenswear of course, but also keeps an eye on Gucci's shoes, watches, perfume and luggage lines, as well as the advertising campaigns. They have also branched out into Home furnishings. In 2000, Gucci bought out YSL Rive Gauche and appointed Tom Ford to take up the design responsibilities of YSL Rive Gauche ready-to-wear. During 2001 there seems to have been some disagreement between Yves St. Laurent and Tom Ford about the way YSL was proceeding. This led to the resignation of Yves St. Laurent in January 2002 from the company he had built. During his time as Creative Director for YSL, Ford won numerous Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards. Like his work at Gucci, Ford was able to catapult the classic fashion house back into the mainstream. His advertising campaigns for the YSL fragrances Opium (with a red-haired Sophie Dahl completely naked wearing only a necklace and stiletto heels in a sexually suggestive pose) and YSL m7 (with martial arts champion Samuel de Cubber in complete full-frontal nudity) have been infamous and provocative by pushing fragrance ads to a new level of creativity in artistic expression and commercial impact. In November 2003 Tom Ford announced that in April, when his contract with Gucci came up for renewal, he would be leaving Gucci. Then in March 2004, he presented his last collections for YSL Rive Gauche and Gucci, amid very emotional farewells. His final show for YSL was a celebrity-studded affair as fans, including fellow designers Diane von Furstenberg, Valentino, Oscar de la Renta, Karl Lagerfeld and Stella McCartney gathered to support and celebrate Ford's work. Having made no secret of the fact that he didn't expect to be designing forever, Ford was rumoured to be making a beeline for Hollywood when his Gucci reign came to an end. He and Domenico de Sole, his colleague who left Gucci with him, set up a new company called just \"Tom Ford\". As the first major initiative, this company has now collaborated with cosmetics giant Estee Lauder to create beauty products and fragrances, plus an eyewear line. Tom Ford Estee Lauder Collection was launched on November 4th, 2005 at Saks Fifth Avenue store. Tom was greeted by crowds of people. In early 2006, Ford was asked to be the guest editor and creative director for the February 2006 Hollywood edition of Vanity Fair. The cover was originally planned to showcase three of Hollywood's most promising young actresses \u2014 Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, and Rachel McAdams. Once shooting began, however, it was quickly decided that the girls should appear in the nude. McAdams was not satisfied with this decision and was excluded from the shot after refusing to remove her clothing. Feeling the photo needed more than two people, Ford stepped in and replaced McAdams. The issue generated criticism, with many claiming that it further perpetuated the need for Hollywood actresses to be sexual icons, since the edition featured no nude actors inside the magazine while featuring several nude actresses, including Angelina Jolie. the label In February 2006, Tom Ford announced a licensing agreement with Ermenegildo Zegna Group for the production and worldwide distribution of lusury men\u2019s ready-to-wear and made-to-measure clothing, footwear andaccessories under the \u201cTom Ford\u201d label. In April 2007, his first directly owned flagship store opened in New York at 845 Madison Avenue to coincide with the much anticipated debut of the signature Tom Ford menswear and accessory collection. In June 2007, Tom Ford International announced a targeted global expansion starting in four directly operated stores that are slated to open over the next three years in Milan, London, Los Angeles, and Hawaii. In addition, Tom Ford announced agreements with key franchise partners that will allow for a focused and select expansion schedule beginning Spring 2008 for key cities in Europe, South America, Asia, and the Middle east. Tom Ford also announced the exclusive limited distribution of the Tom Ford Menswear collection in select luxury retail partners in the US and Europe beginning in spring 2008. The resulting overall plan will create more than 100 free standing Tom Ford retail stores worldwide over the next 10 years as well as a tightly controlled distribution network of shop in shops with luxury retailer partners.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":["Madonna","Brad Pitt","Lindsay Lohan","Jennifer Aniston","Sally Field"],"perfumes":["2005 Youth Dew - Amber Nude (W)","2005 Black Orchid (W)","2006 Private Blend (set of 12) (W)","2007 Azure Soleil (W)","2007 tOM fORD FOR MEN"],"social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tomford","brands":["Tom Ford","Tom Ford Eyewear"]}

Tommy was a frustrated athlete, too small to make the school teams but a ripe candidate for the counter-culture. He is a graduater of Elmira Free Academy. He initial foray into fashion was a store called \u201cThe People\u2019s Place\u201d. The store was a big draw for the local teen crowd in Elmira because it often held live broadcasts from local radio personalities, sold rock and roll related clothing including Kiss and Aerosmith belt buckles, and had a discreet head shop upstairs which sold drug related paraphernalia such as bongs, roach clips, and incense. There he designed under the name Jacob Alan and sold these clothes in his store. \n   By 1975, he had a chain of seven stores, but lost them all in 1976 when he went bankrupt due to too much partying. Because of that he moved to New York in 1979 to pursue a career as a fashion designer. In 1984 he founded the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation, introducing his signature menswear collection. He got married to a girl named Susie, and had 4 children on the way. His wife had gone to Fashion School. On their honeymoon, they went to India and designed a line of clothing backed by a local factory owner. Back in New York, he collaborated with Mohan Murjan, the man who made Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans the first mass-market fashion product. Together they made youthful clothes for the Coca-Cola logo. Sales really started taking off in 1989 when designer fashion was losing its share of the market and easy-to-buy lines offered the best of both worlds. In 1992, his company went public and in 1994 against sold more shares. It used the capital to open hundreds of boutiques in large stores. They exploded. In 1992, the breakthrough in the market came, when Hilfiger's clothes first caught on in a big way with black teenagers. This happened because they were worn by the Hip-Hop entertainers like Snoop Doggy Dog, the Fugees and others. For his womens wear, he lined up Quincy Jones' daughter Kidada to help him sell his gear. Going into the 21st century, Hilfiger's clothes dominate streetwise sportswear and his distinctive red, white and blue logo is seen everywhere. His mastery of the street market has made a lasting impact on fashion. Tommy has also started designing dresses for the up-scale market. After September 11th 2001 terrorist attack, American flags became extremely popular.

{"designer_name":"Thierry Hermes","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/thierry-hermes\/"],"biography":"  Fashion Designer Thierry Hermes founded his saddlery company in 1837. His family were originally Protestants from Germany who settled in Paris around 1828. Gradually he added boots, jewelry, home decor items, and silk scarves. \n His son Charles-Emile Hermes (1835-1919) and grandsons Adolphe Hermes and Emile-Maurice (1870-1951) continued to run the family firm after Thierry died. \n   Emile-Maurice Hermes, Theirry's successor, realized at the turn of the 20th century that travel was fast moving away from the horse and towards plane, car, and train travel. He responded by manufacturing trunks, bags, overnight cases, all from his family's signature saddle leather. He also purchased the building at 24 Rue Faubourg St.-Honor\u00e9 in Paris, which still houses the flagship store as well as the workshops. When the first Hermes store opened in its current Paris location in the 1930s, the famous silk Hermes scarf soon became a great success. It is inspired by the scarf, which Napoleon's soldier wore. It became a masculine accessory for the newly liberated women of the Golden '20s. All of the Hermes products are inspired by horses or horse motifs. Scarves, for both men and women, are until today their most popular product. When Emile-Maurice died in 1951, his son-in-laws Robert Dumas (1905-1978) and Jean-Rene Guerrand (1901-1993) took over Hermes. They added the name Hermes to their own surname. Robert Dumas-Hermes introduced the Hermes Tie, the Beach towel, and the Perfume. When Robert Dumas died in 1978, his son Jean-Louis Dumas-Hermes (born 1938) took over the company. He is the 5th generation Chairman of Hermes. He is very much a \"hands-on\" chairman, taking a personal interest in every Hermes product or development. He travels extensively all over the world, and brings back ideas which go into Hermes product lines. His wife Rena is Greek-born and is very involved with charitable activities and philanthropy. His son Pierre-Alexis is studying in Art school. Emile-Maurice Hermes travelled through Europe and Russia in the first few years of the 20th century. He became a supplier of saddles to the Czar. In Canada, buying gear, he spotted the zip and brought it back to France. In 1918 the first leather Golf jacket with a zip was made by Hermes. He saw that the days of the horse-carriage were numbered and Hermes luggage of all sizes was the result. Today, in Hermes leather storage facility in Paris, lie hundreds of the finest animal skins, alligator from Florida, buffalo from Pakistan, crocodile from Australia, sharks from Thailand, lizards from Malaysia, oxen, deer, calf and goats from all over the world. These are dyed in every colour, pattern and texture imaginable and turned into stylish accessories. In 1922 the wife of Emile-Maurice Hermes complained that she could not find a handbag that she liked. So he began making handbags at Hermes, many with the revolutionary invention - the zip - for which he held the patent. Hermes now makes so many beautiful handbags of all shapes and sizes. Some of the most famous are: Kelly Bag 1956 - named after Grace Kelly. Constance Bag - Jackie Onassis wore this shoulder bag with the double strap and big H clasps, so often that people often ask for the Jackie O bag. Birkin Bag 1984 - named after Jane Birkin, the film star and model of the 1960's, who met Jean-Louis when struggling to get her handbag on a plane overhead locker. There is a one-year waiting list for ladies ordering this bag. Hermes first women's collection was shown in Paris in 1929. Initially couture clothing was made, up until 1956. Over the years the ready-to-wear collections have been designed by Lola Prusac, Jacques Delahaye, Catherine de Karolyi, Monsieur Levaillant, Nicole de Vesian, Eric Bergere, Claude Brouet, Tan Giudicelli, Marc Audibet, Veronique Nichanian and Mariot Chane. From 1998 to 2003 Belgian designer Martin Margiela was the designer. The reclusive, avant-garde designer known for his deconstructed clothing produced simple elegant modern clothes for Hermes. In early 2003 it has been announced that Frenchman Jean-Paul Gaultier will be the designer for future collections for Hermes.","the_look":"One of Hermes' most recognized products is the silk scarf. The first silk scarf square in the Hermes collection was produced in 1928, and in 1937 a dedicated scarf factory was established in Lyon. The modern Hermes scarf measures 90cm square, weighs 65 grams and is woven from the silk of 250 mulberry moth cocoons. The per-pound cost of a scarf today is approximately $1,965.00 (compared to a pound of steel at $0.19).\nAll Hermes scarves are hand-printed using multiple silk screens (up to 30, one for each color on the scarf) and the hems are all hand-stitched. Two scarf collections per year are released, along with re-prints of older designs and limited editions. Since 1937, Hermes has produced over 25,000 unique designs and the rarer scarves are much sought-after by collectors.\nThe ubiquitous Brides De Gala scarf, first introduced in the 1970s, has been sold over 70,000 times. An Hermes scarf is sold somewhere in the world every 25 seconds, global volume sales peaking in the late 1980s at over 1.1 million scarves. There has been some suggestion that the hijab controversy has dampened sales of women's headscarves, with Hermes volumes suffering as a result. New scarves retail at $320 and still account for a significant percentage of Hermes\u2019 turnover. \nIn addition to fine silk scarves, men's neckties are made out of the same silks and with the same care. Their witty and frivolous patterns are popular with preppies and politicians alike, including US Senator John Kerry. Hermes ties cost $145.\nHermes handbags have always been coveted pieces of handmade leather craftmanship. Hermes does not use assembly lines, rather, only one artist may work on one handbag at a time. Because of the use of rare materials (sometimes including exotic skins such as alligator, ostrich, and crocodile as well as precious metals) and because only the highest quality craftmanship is accepted, one bag can take 18 to 24 hours to create.\nThe Kelly bag was named for Grace Kelly, who made it famous after appearing on the cover of Life in 1956 carrying the bag. Jacqueline Bouvier Onassis, another Hermes aficionado, preferred the Constance shoulder bag (with a double strap and large H clasp) or the Trim shoulder bag. Perhaps the most famous handbag, the Birkin, was named for actress Jane Birkin, who co-designed the bag with president Jean-Louis Dumas after complaining that her Kelly was not practical for everyday use.\nMore recently, due to media spotlight in television shows such as Sex and the City and Gilmore Girls, the Birkin Bag has become a symbol of ultimate luxury. Generally, these bags start at $6,000 and easily make their way into 5-digit, sometimes 6-digit figures.\nThe alleged waiting list for a Birkin is now over two years and it is now closed to the public. In reality, there is no real waiting list. A customer can readily walk into a Hermes shop and purchase a Birkin bag if the shop manager feels that the customer is a legitimate buyer and not one who simply buys the Birkin bag to resell it to others.\nBirkin bags are readily available in the large Hermes shops throughout the world. The Birkin is highly coveted, possibly the most coveted bag available today.","who_wears_it":["Queen Elizabeth II","Grace Kelly","Audrey Hepburn","Catherine Deneuve","Jacqueline Bouvier Onassis","Sharon Stone","Sarah Jessica Parker","Hillary Clinton","Elly McPherson","Madonna"],"perfumes":["1951 Eau d'Hermes (W)","1951 Eau d'Hermes (M)","1961 Caleche (W)","1970 Equipage (M)","1975 Amazone (W)","1979 Eau de Cologne Hermes (M)","1979 Hermes d'Orange Vert (M)","1984 Parfum d'Hermes (W)","1986 Bel Ami (M)","1994 Amazone Fresh (W)","1995 24 Faubourg (W)","1996 Fetes en Hermes (W)","1997 24 Faubourg Light (W)","1998 Rocabar (M)","1999 Hiris (W)","1999 Eau d'Orange Vert (M)","1999 Eau d'Orange Vert (W)","2000 Rouge Hermes (W)","2000 Caleche (W)","2001 Caleche Eau Delicate (W)","2002 24 Faubourg Eau de Soleil (W)","2002 Rouge Hermes Eau Delicate (W)","2003 Un Jardin en Mediterranee (W)","2003 Aroma D'orange Verte(Eau Tonique Givree) (W)","2003 24 Faubourg Eau Delicate (W)","2004 Eau des Merveilles (W)","2004 Hermessence Ambre Narguile (U)","2004 Hermessence Poivre Samarcande (U)","2004 Hermessence Rose Ikebana (U)","2004 Hermessence Vetiver Tonku (U)","2007 Kelly Caleche (W)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":[]}

His original ambition was to be a plastic surgeon. However, somehow he went into the design field nearest to that aim, the making of luxury leather garments. \n He studied for six years at London's renowned fashion school Central St. Martin's where he completed both a first class honours degree and masters degree in fashion design. He also attended classes at the Cordwainer's College, specializing in many aspects of leather working and moulding, techniques which he continued to use throughout his work. \n Then he started up his concern and showed his first collection in London in 1997, showing at the Cafe de Paris with a collection named \"Genus Orchidaon Daemonix\" \n   In 1999 and 2000, his collections have broadened beyond only leather creations, to garments made of other materials and has plans for a complete line of luxury dresses in all materials. For Spring 2001 Webber viewed women as intergalactic warriors but for Fall 2001, he brought us back to earth. He showed a softer side by infusing orchids and flowers in structured and architectural designs. The Spring 2002 collection shows this young designer rapidly gaining assurance. It was his best yet, adding an airy light to his modernist style. Delicate colours and prints made each dress totally contemporary, yet never unwearable. The collection is selling in Harrods of London and his capsule collection for Debenhams, is body hugging shapes and futuristic prints in high-tech fabrics. He is firmly on the path to success.","the_look":"The focal point for Webber's work is luxury, particularly in leather. Although leather makes up the main part of his work, he also uses sharkskin, real fur, wool and rubber latex in his collections. His compositions are hard and soft, assertive yet fragile. \nHis leather designs are inspired by muscle patterns and some of the more intricate pieces are embroidered with interpretations of muscle form. He says: \"There is always a strong concept behind my work, but I don't expect everyone to get it. What I do is not disposable fashion, London needs more luxury goods, but modern and hard.\" \nStripped of all conceptualism, however, Webber's clothes remain beautiful precision-cut luxurypieces.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tristan.webber","brands":[]}

From his father he learned not only the tricks of the trade, but also two characteristics that are found in the Berluti family to this day: love of his work, no matter how demanding, and a spirit of conquest. To these he would add a quality of his own - an infinite love of shoes, which he saw with the aesthetic eye of a sculptor. He loved the shoes he made so much that it was difficult for him to be separated from them when the customer arrived to pick them up. \n The Duke of Windsor, one of the greatest Berluti customers, would say that the Napoleon II shoe, which was high-cut with elastic sides, offers something both nice and naughty. \n In 1928, he left his native Italy for France and set to \n   work establishing the Berluti style through iconic & emblematic styles. Berluti creations began being compared to works of art by connoisseurs and dandies.

Father and son had complimentary roles: Talbinio, intellectual, imaginative and Torello, the hardworking craftsman. \n Talbinio sketched his designs everywhere: in restaurants, on paper tablecloths, in notebooks, on book covers. His father worked with his hands, like a sculptor. He too was a man of designs- outlines, sketches and ideas. In the early forties, together they originated laced mocassins, which would become one of the Maison Berluti's iconic emblems. \n In 1959, Talbinio launched luxury ready-to-wear shoes. With the innovation of luxury ready-to-wear shoes and their more affordable prices, the Maison Berluti was able to attract a clientele of creative young artists with more limited means. Because of the ready-to-wear collection, a greater number of people were able to wear Berluti footwear, which in turn enabled Berluti to expand. \n   Talbinio tirelessly expanded the enterprise that his father had left in his hands. He was a cultivated man and his engaging conversation flourished with his friends and clients.  These special friends and clients attachment to the Maison Berluti was also due to the very Italian ambiance and sense of enjoyment they found there: Sergio Leone, Jean Cocteau, Edith Piaf... Between 1960 and 1980, Torello developed Berluti restlessly.

Later she studied art at the Royal Holloway College in Egham, Surrey. \n In 1953 she established Greek Street in Soho, a boutique selling textiles from the near East and clothing of her own designs. She sold bedspreads, pillows and caftans. The caftans were selling so well, she couldn't keep her store stocked, so she began designing and producing them in England.

Porter had long admired Arabic clothing, entranced by the rich embroideries and fabrics, in shapes producing a protected and secure feeling of being able to hide in one's clothes while feeling like a princess, in the richness of execution of her romantic fantasies.\nPorter's nostalgic sensibilities also extended toward the Renaissance and the Edwardian periods. During the 1970s she offered high-waisted midi-or maxi-dresses with voluminous sleeves. These simple historic shapes also lent themselves to luxurious brocades, tapestries, velvets, and embroidery. Her Edwardian looks featured vintage trimmings, and sailor-collared or lacy dresses recalling the last days of the Imperial Russian Grand Duchesses. Porter claimed Chekhov as an influence as well as art d\u00e9co. Gypsy dresses with their full-flounced skirts allowed for romantic play of colorful patterned fabrics. Again, the shapes were easy, flattering.","who_wears_it":["Taylor","Raquel Welch","Charlotte Rampling","Barbra Streisand","Beatles","Rolling Stones","Donovan","Princess Margaret","Jessey Norman"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

He remembers the confusion and shock to the older generation caused by fashion, noting that men growing their hair slightly longer than the norm and \"Mothers used to cry and make their sons wear hairnets to the office\". \n In 1969 he moved to 430 Kings Road with Trevor Miles and launched a fashion and furniture shop called Mr Freedom. It was the antithesis of hippie fashion which was built around a hard edged, pop inspired look full of bright, bold, blocks of colour. Amongst the items on sale there were pop-art items designed by Jim Dines and furniture designed by the Yorkshire born architect and interior designer Jon Wealleans who was a graduate of the Royal College of Art. These particular styles were very popular amongst clients such as Pablo Picasso and the Rolling Stones. \n Tommy Roberts moved to a bigger and better shop in Kensington called City Lights, leaving Trevor Miles to turn 430 Kings Road into a shop called Paradise Garrage and fill it with dungarees and Hawaiian shirts. Paradise Garage itself ended unceremoniously when Trevor Miles went away on an extended break, leaving Bradley Mendelshn in charge. Unknown to the owner, Bradley struck a deal with Vivienne Westwood, Malcolm McLaren and their art-school friend Patrick Casey who took over the back part of the store where they would sell radios, records and clothes. They were thrown out when Trevor Miles returned, but they were already so popular he ended up turning the premises over to them. \n   Tommy Roberts then joined up with the singer from the group Syn, Stephen Nardelli (after Syn disbanded he'd opend a fashion boutique in Kensington Church Street, and went on to jointly own a chain of fashion stores in Chelsea and Kensington with Ian Ross) to launch Fresh Records through WEA.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

When a customer brought in a silver champagne flute for repair, bearing the inscription \u201cGood Morning, Diana\u201d, Theo was struck by the witty and romantic gesture, and quite taken with the idea of the glamorous and intoxicated Diana.

Their marriage lasted three years before she met Malcolm McLaren who became her partner in fashion as well as live, later known for being the manager for punk band The Sex Pistols. Westwood and McLaren had a son named Joseph, and Vievienne continued to teach until 1971, when Malcolm decided to open a shop, \u2018Sex\u2019, and this is where Vivienne began to sell her outrageous designs. Another shop was open in the same year together with McLaren, she started up a shop called \u201cLet it Rock\u201d on London\u2019s trendy Kings Road.

The \u2018punk style\u2019 included BDSM fashion, bondage gear, safety pins, razor blades, bicycle or lavatory chains on clothing and spiked dog collars that were used as jewellery as well as the outrageous make-up and hair. Together, Vivienne and McLaren revolutionised fashion and the impact is still felt today.

Vivienne\u2019s first runway show was the Pirate collection in London, March 1981. Her design style had evolved so that her main interests included not only the youth and street culture but also tradition and technique. Vivienne worked historical factors into her collection by using historical 17th-18th century original cutting principles and modernising them. This collection was all about 'gold and treasure, adventure and exploration'. 1982 She introduced the first collection in her own name which proved very popular. Her collections were called Buffalo, Savage, and Punkature. 1983 She gave a fashion show in Paris, the first British designer to do so since Mary Quant in the 60's. People remember it as one of the best shows ever, but chic Parisiennes were horrified by the riotous behaviour and punky London garments. The collection was called \"Punkature\".

She opened a studio in London's Camden area, a 19 km bicycle ride from her modest apartment in South London. 1984 Her collection was called Hypnos, the first sports collection with fluorescent fabrics on the catwalk. 1985 Vivienne Westwood based her collection on Clint Eastwood, the film star. 1985 She launched her \"mini-crini\" a very short crinoline design, which took off like a rocket. 1992 She was awarded an O.B.E. and went to receive it from the Queen in a see-through blouse, and a skirt which when swirled around displayed her lack of underwear.

He also owns the lingerie label Agent Provocateur.","the_look":"Vivienne Westwood is fashion's chief architect of revolt. She was once queen of punk and is no stranger to the forms of sabotage that can pave the way for the next upheaval in style or taste. Her clothes are revolutionary and controversial. Her designs include intentionally twisted seams, intentionally badly cut clothes, designs intended to shock, deliberate contradictions of colour. She ignores conventional fashion directions and goes her own way. She is queen of the original: bustiers, mens kilts, cone-shaped bras as day wear; classical paintings on underwear; the mini crinoline, fake fur trains, woolly royal crowns and so on. Surprisingly, other well-known designers have lavished praise on Vivienne. Rei Kawakubo, the famous Japanese designer says \"I think Vivienne's means of expression is profound.

She had originally dreamed of being an Olympic figure skater, but when she did not make the team in 1968, she went to the Sorbonne, in Paris and to Sarah Lawrence College in the USA, to study. She has a BA in Liberal Arts. \n In 1970, at the age of 21, on graduating, Vera became the youngest editor ever at Vogue magazine. She remained there for 17 years till 1987. She gave up the idea of studying at fashion school in New York, because she said later that her father could not afford further education for her, and she found that VOGUE was the best training ground any designer could have. \n   When she left Vogue, she worked with Ralph Lauren for 2 years. She decided to leave him when she was 40 years old, and set up as a bridalwear designer. She married Arthur Becker in 1989 and has two daughters. She discussed with Calvin Klein, the idea of opening her own bridalwear salon and he thought she was crazy. And so in 1990, she opened her own house on Madison Avenue, New York, designing bridal wear and evening gowns. In 1994, she started her own label. Vera says that one of the important reasons for her success, is her admiration of the work of Yves St. Laurent with it's chic, creative and cultured style. She credits her mother for taking her to YSL's salon in Paris when she was growing up, implanting within her a fascination with fashion and style. Her appreciation of surface decoration, particularly beading, and the use of net to give the illusion of bare skin, have also recommended her for the design of Olympic figure-skating costumes - so bringing her back full-circle to her childhood dreams. Her search for perfection even drove her to invest $ 4 million on publishing her book \"Vera Wang on Weddings\" in 2001. Vera opened a bridal boutique in Shanghai in October 2005, called the Perfect Wedding. The fashion crowd which gathered for the opening could see for themselves that a designer with a Chinese heritage could have global appeal. Vera Wang and her good friend Anna Sui, are symbolic among Chinese people for having become so successful in America. the label Vera does not release sales figures to the public, but Vera Wang Bridal House, creating wedding and evening wear, has been bolstered by VEW the licensing division, apparently turning over about $ 300,000 a year.

She has been a jewelry fanatic since watching her grandmother, Sylvia Hennessy of Hennessy cognac fame, change her baubles to match her different outfits several times a day. By the time she was 11, de Castellane was sketching her jewelry designs and having them made at an atelier. She even melted down her catechism medals and turned them into trinkets. \n The jewelry designer's fashion roots run deep - she is the niece of Gilles Dufour, Karl Lagerfeld's longtime assistant at Chanel, and she spent 14 years designing jewels chez Chanel - but her career is entirely talent based. And it is her playfulness that truly sets her apart. \n   De Castellane has been designing haute joaillerie for Christian Dior since their jewelry line was launched in 1998. And this fall, when Dior opens its fourth boutique at Place Vendome in the heart of Paris's formidable jewelry district, she will be taken even further in to the fold.

She always thinks about what she wants and what she does not have. And the jewelry pieces take shapes in her mind when she thinking. Until now, Victoire still imagines she was a princess wearing jewelry. And that is why her works are always full of fantastic touches of fairy tales.

Together with Hardy Amies and Edward Molyneux, he created clothing ranges that could be mass-produced using minimal materials and labour, and selling under the CC41 Utility label. It is clear that the fabric-saving styles of the 1940s were a thing of the past by the time Stiebel designed this sophisticated gown. The long, full skirts of the mid-1950s reflect Britain's post-war optimism and prosperity, as fabric and labour were no longer reserved for the troops, and rationing had at last become a thing of the past. He reopened his own house in 1958, having great initial success, but being forced to close after only 5 years in 1963 on health grounds. Stiebel was commissioned to design new uniforms for the WRENS (1951) and the WRAF (1954) whilst also creating the going-away outfit for Princess Margaret on her marriage to Lord Snowdon in 1960. He was for many years the companion of composer Richard Addinsell.","the_look":"His clothes were romantic, and at times experimental with his use of stripes, plaid and pleating.\nPieces by Stiebel are rare.

The collection was comprised of preexisting pieces of garments blended into a collage, to create new clothing. In 1998, Viktor & Rolf put on an unauthorized, underground fashion show during Paris Fashion Week designed to attract members of the press. Ready-to-wear and their menswear label \"Monsieur\" were to follow over the next five years. With their reputation as fashion designers and artists, Viktor & Rolf have recently segued more into ready-to-wear collections, yet without detracting from their reputations as designers of art. Their first ready-to-wear collection, in collaboration with Gibo SpA, was launched in 2000; the lines was more wearable and functional, like jeans, ruffled shirts, and sexy pantsuits, which exhibited the designers' fondness for masculine styling for women. In 2003, the Fashion Museum in Paris presented a 10-year retrospective of the designers' work. In 2005 they opened their first shop in the Golden Quadrilateral (Quadrilatero d'Oro) in Milan (which closed in 2008), and were contracted by L'Or\u00e9al to develop their first perfume, called Flowerbomb. In 2006, their first men's perfume, Antidote, was introduced in the US. In November 2006, Viktor & Rolf followed Karl Lagerfeld and Stella McCartney in designing a line for the Swedish-based retailer H&M. In 2008 an exhibition entitled \"The House of Viktor & Rolf\"  was presented at the Barbican Art Gallery, celebrating the duo's 15-year anniversary. Key pieces from 1992 to 2008 were remade as detailed miniatures and presented on hand-made porcelain dolls, in a large doll house. In 2008, Viktor & Rolf announced that Renzo Rosso \u2014owner of Diesel Jeans, chairman of Only the Brave (OTB)\u2014 had taken a controlling stake in their company. Viktor & Rolf stated that this deal is meant to allow their company to put out a wider range of products and to open more stores. Adhering to their reputation to intrigue and fascinate, Viktor & Rolf created Le parfum to awaken the fashion industry's senses with a perfume that provided no scent. The 250 limited edition bottles of Le parfum were never meant to be opened; another step clearly meant to integrate fashion as an art form.","the_look":"Viktor & Rolf\u2014purveyors of elaborate style and exotic design, are as much known for their works of art as they are for fashion.

Always adding to the fabrics, Viktor & Rolf often use ornamentation that mocks accessories, including Christmas trees balls, colorful tinsel garlands, and pleated Pierrot collars. This is a clear indication of their reputation to shock and challenge fashion and remain with the forerunners of originality. Their creation of the unusual \"atomic bomb,\" for example, was a shrewd combination of extreme fashion and art.

But it was Torun who became the most famous, as the first woman silversmith in the world to gain international recognition. \n Torun studied at Konstfack, the School of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, beginning in 1945 while pregnant with her first child, Pia. Eventually she married the child's father, a Danish journalism student. In 1948, Torun spent the summer in Paris meeting Picasso, Braque, Matisse and the other great artists of the day. She married a French architect and lived in Stockholm until 1956 having a second child, a son, Claude. As early as 1952, Torun exhibited her jewelry, made both in Stockholm and France (and bearing hallmarks from each country) in Paris. \n In 1956, Torun and her husband divorced and she lost custody of her son. She moved to France with her third husband, Walter Coleman, an Afro-American painter, meeting many of the jazz greats of that time. She designed jewelry for among others, Billie Holiday which Holiday wore when she performed. The couple moved to Biot in the south of France in 1958 to avoid political problems they were encountering in Paris as a result of the war in Algeria.Torun produced many pieces during this period when young Swedish silversmiths would come to work in her studio, introducing her to new techniques. Torun renewed her acquaintance with Picasso who lived in the area and an exhibition of Torun jewelry was held at the Picasso museum in Antibes from 1958 to 1960. Torun had two children with Walter, Ira and Marcia. \n   In 1965, her marriage broke up and in 1966, she became involved with the Subud spiritual movement, an association which continues to today. In 1961, Torun won the Lunning Prize which was awarded from 1951 to the 1970s to someone who had \"pioneered a unique artistic contribution\". In 1968, she moved to Wolfsburg Germany and in 1975 to the neighboring village of Wendhausen to be closer to the Subud community. She had a workshop and worked with other artists in an association called \"Die Schwinge\".Beginning in 1967, Torun's production was taken over by Georg Jensen silver. Since moving to Germany, Torun has worked on things other than jewelry including cutlery, chinaware and handbags. In 1978, Torun moved to Indonesia where she still lives. On November 5, 1992, Torun was awarded the Prince Eugen medal by King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden. The medal ia bestowed for outstanding artistic achievement. In September of 1992 Georg Jensen in Copenhagen held an exhibition to celebrate 25 years of Torun's association with the company, 45 years of working with silver and her 65th birthday. From October 1992 to January 1993, the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in the Louvre held a 45 year retrospective of Torun's work.","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

He was first introduced to fashion through his grandmother\u2019s closet, which was filled with an elegant collection by designers such as Christian Dior, Balenciaga, Chanel and Schiaparelli. Seduced by the tapered silhouettes, brilliant colors and rich fabrics, de Souza knew at an early age that design was his calling. \n Although his newfound passion was frowned upon by his family, he found a way to act upon his desire to design by hand-sewing garments for his sisters and their dolls from ordinary bed linens. At the age of fourteen Victor de Souza enrolled in a couture academy in Argentina, he later studied at two other Argentinean couture academies and CETIC (Centro De Estudios Tecnicos Para La Industria De La Confeccion). In school, he quickly acquired a reputation as a perfectionist because of his obsession with constructing garments that fit the form perfectly. He designed his first collection in Argentina by the age of eighteen. \n In October 2002 de Souza made his debut couture collection at Paris Fashion Week. The showing was held at the American Consulate, as part of a special group event entitled \u201cAmericans in Paris.\u201d This same year, editors and stylists began noticing his designs when Alicia Keys appeared at the NFL kick-off party in Times Square in 2002, wearing one of de Souza\u2019s signature corsets.

{"designer_name":"Willi Donnell Smith","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/willi-donnell-smith\/"],"biography":"Willi Donnell Smith was one of the most successful African-American fashion designers in fashion history. At the time of his death, his company Williwear Ltd. sold $25 million worth of clothing a year. \n Willi Smith was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA in 1948. \n As a boy Smith spent a lot of time drawing with his mother, and he nurtured dreams of becoming an artist. After his parents were divorced, his grandmother, Gladys Bush, became an important figure in motivating Smith to pursue his artistic interests. She defended her grandson when he missed family curfews because of lingering too long at the Philadelphia Museum of Art or when he spent untold hours sitting on the floor sketching. While studying fashion illustration at the Philadelphia Museum College of Art in 1964, Smith began developing a greater interest in clothing design. \n   In 1967, Smith quit Parsons to pursue a career designing on his own. In 1969 he designed a label for Digits, a sportswear company. In 1973, Smith, along with his sister Toukie Smith, founded their own clothing company that soon failed. He graduated in 1968 and became a freelance knitwear designer. He worked for New York designer Arnold Scaasi in the mid-1970's. In 1976, he opened WilliWear, his Sportswear company. He said that he wanted to plug the gap between Jeans and stiff evening wear. The following winter Smith's collection generated only about $30,000 of business, but one of Smith's pants designs became extremely popular. Characteristic of what would become the Willi Smith look, the pants were a baggy fatigue with a high, wrapped waist and became known as the \"WilliWear pant.\" Before long the streetwise and sassy WilliWear designs caught the public's attention in a big way, and other designers soon copied the style. Smith's next collection sold $200,000; by 1982 WilliWear had an annual gross topping $5 million. In 1978 Smith introduced WilliWear Men, a line of clothes that incorporated both formality and casualness. Smith worked with many other designers and artists during his time at Williwear including Anthony Mark Hankins, James Mischka, Julia Santos-Solomon, Jon Coffelt, John Bartlett and Andre Walker among many others. Smith partnered with Jhane Barnes on some of his earlier shows. In 1983, Willi Smith won the coveted Coty Award. Willi was a good friend of the singer Madonna in the 1980's and she still remembers him affectionately. In 1985, he created the uniforms worn by workings draping the Pont Neuf for Christo's artwork. In 1987 he designed the clothes worn at the wedding of Caroline Kennedy, President Kennedy's daughter. Several young designers worked with Willi, one of whom in 1986 was Anthony Mark Hankins, an African-American Texan designer, now coming into prominence. James Mischka (partner in Badgley-Mischka design house) worked under Willi Smith from 1985 to 1986. John Bartlett took over the design when Willi Smith died, and remained till 1990. Willi Smith died of complications of AIDS in 1987. At that time it was a relatively unknown disease and there was no cure. People with a gay lifestyle were most at risk till the 1990's when the medical profession understood AIDS better. Smith, who was openly gay, has a panel in the original NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt and is also lamented in a poem \"Speak: A Poem for the Millennium March by Keith Boykin, read by its author for the Millennium March on Washington for Equality on April 29, 2000. His company continued to function after his death, opening it's first store in New York on Fifth Avenue in 1988. In 2000-2002, the city of New York decided to honour American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along 7th Avenue, the great street of fashion in New York. This has been called the \"FASHION WALK OF FAME.\" Willi Smith was one of those honoured. Many of his garments are nowadays found on vintage clothing outlets, on the net and in shops. They are quite popular. On the right is a cotton padded three quarter length warm coat with toggle buttons, from the mid-1980's, on sale today. It has his trademark graffiti print on the inside.","the_look":"His oversized clothing anticipated the casual styles and attitudes of the following decades: baggy trousers and shorts, slouchy sweaters and generously proportioned shirts. Nowadays the rap style is almost identical to the designs which he started in the 1970's and 1980's. \nHis colours and fabrics were bright and easily mixed together. \nWilli Smith's moderately priced clothes tended to be exuberant and youthful. He made slouchy blazers, long full dirndle skirts, oversize shirts, dhoti pants and tank tops. His evening clothes were peppy such as pouf-skirted dresses with slits as high as the waist, or with racing-back necklines. \nHis sister Tookie Smith, born in 1954, is an actress. She had twin boys by a surrogate. She had a relationship with actor Robert de Niro for some time. \nPerhaps in part due to his Indian cottons and colors, or to his inexhaustible appeal to youth, or maybe just due to his own wit and sense of loose fit, Smith excelled in clothing for summer. His winter collections, too, were especially notable for oversized coats based on classic shapes. His WilliWear News for fall 1986 proclaimed with irony his intention to get \"serious\" with the fall collection. In a sense, Smith never was serious, preferring instead a lively incongruity he had learned from observation and refined from affordable clothing made in India.\nHis soft, baggy looks did not require sophisticated tailoring and benefitted from the Indian textiles that he chose for their supple hand, easy care and comfortable aging, and indescribably indefinite colors. Smith's slouchy softness was a \"real people\" look, marketed at modest costs with great impact in the 1980s as the informality of designer jeans and other casual wear was replaced by the kind of alternative Smith's designs offered\u2014a drapey silhouette for comfortable clothing with style.","who_wears_it":["Caroline Kennedy","Madonna","Mary Jane Watson","Edwin Schlossberg"],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

He is perhaps best-known for dressing Marilyn Monroe. By 1952 he was close friends with Marilyn Monroe and created the costumes for Don't Bother to Knock and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. As William Travilla was her favorite designer, he went on to design the costumes for several more of her films. Later in 1953, Travilla created one of the most iconic costumes . It was a snow white cocktail dress Marilyn wore in the film \"The Seven Year Itch\". She wore it as she stands on a New York subway ventilation grate and the dress raises up around her as a train passes below ground. This photographs of this scene have become synonymous with Monroe herself. She once wrote to Travilla \"Billy Dear, please dress me forever. I love you, Marilyn.\" \n Following Marilyn\u2019s death, Travilla vowed to protect his good friends\u2019 memory. While many pieces were sold by the Studio, Travilla placed his items and designs under lock and key in his private quarters. Hence, the collection became known as THE LOST COLLECTION. \n   Travilla first came to Hollywood in 1941. After work on several B movies, he earned an Oscar in 1949 for the Errol Flynn swashbuckler Adventures of Don Juan. He joined Columbia in 1942 and left in 1943, then three years with Warner Brothers from 1946 to 1949. He was under contract to Twentieth Century-Fox from 1949 to 1956. He went on to design River of No Return, Broken Lance (1954), The Rains of Ranchipur (1955), Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955), The Tall Men (1955), Bus Stop (1956), The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown (1957) and Valley of the Dolls in 1967. Travilla's was also nominated for the Academy Award for How to Marry a Millionaire in 1953, There's No Business Like Show Business in 1954 and The Stripper in 1963. During the 1950s William started designing his clothing lines setting up his salon in Los Angeles. He became well-known for what was called \"California\" fashion. This meant comfortable elegant clothes without the restricting and rigid construction of Paris haute couture garments. Even as he developed his high fashion business, he continued to design for both film and the small screen. In the late 1970s, Travilla began working mainly in television. One of his most widely seen latter day projects was the TV mini-series The Thorn Birds in 1983. Travilla was nominated for Emmy awards seven times for his work on television. In 1980, he won the Emmy for \"Outstanding Costume Design for a Limited Series or a Special\" for \"The Scarlett O'Hara War\", and in 1985 he won the \"Outstanding Costume Design for a Series\" Emmy for his work on the television show Dallas, for creating extravagant dresses for the rich bitchy characters. He was an avid sportsman, and enjoyed life up to the end. Travilla passed away in 1990 leaving his lifetime works to Bill Sarris. It is now the wish of Bill Sarris, partner of Bill Travilla, owner of Travilla, Inc., and friend of Ms. Monroe that these iconic and priceless items of fashion and art history be displayed in a manner respectful to the memory of Bill Travilla and Marilyn Monroe. Bill Sarris also hopes to raise awareness and funds for Alzheimer charities too, a disease he now sadly suffers from, via the series of Travilla exhibitions.

{"designer_name":"Yves Saint Laurent","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/yves-saint-laurent\/"],"biography":"the designer \n On 1st August 1936 in Oran, Algeria, Yves Mathieu Saint Laurent was born, where his father worked in insurance. When he was a child, they moved to France. In 1953, when he was 17, Yves arrived in Paris, and entered the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture School. He entered a competition organised by the International Wool Secretariat, and won first prize with an asymmetrically draped, one-sleeved cocktail dress. Coincidentally, another prize winner in this same competition was Karl Lagerfeld in the coat category. \n Michel de Brunhoff, the editor of Vogue, introduced him to Christian Dior, who took him on to work with him until Christain Dior\u2019s death in 1957. He impressed Christian Dior immensely and in October 1957 Dior said to his staff \" there are 3O designs in my latest collection which are based on Yves's work, he is an exceptional talent, I want him to be recognized. His staff said that YSL was still very young and that he should wait a little longer. Dior said he would bring him out at the next collection. But it was not to be, he died just a few days later. Yves Saint Laurent took over as Art Director at Christain Dior Company, and his first collection in 1958, the \u201cLing Trap\u00e9ze\u201d, became a resounding success the world over. YSL presented 6 collections for Dior, although by then the staff at Dior were beginning to get a little upset at what they felt was rather a too flamboyant style for sedate Dior. The clientele however, adored his designs. One person in particular, the Duchess of Windsor bought many of his creations. \n   In 1958 he purchased one of his black rose-covered tulle evening dresses which he afterwards donated to the V&A London permanent costume collection. The 1960 Spring\/Summer collection was BEATNIK, all motorcycle jackets made of alligator skin, mink coats with ribbed sweater sleeves and turtlenecks under finely cut suits. It was highly praised by the public, as one of the most beautiful and youthful collections the house had ever produced. But it caused an uproar with Dior staff and particularly with Marcel Boussac, who controlled the DIOR company. It was felt that YSL had misjudged the staid clientele of Dior. In 196O YSL left on compulsory military service but suffered a nervous collapse and was discharged. He returned to find that Dior had installed Marc Bohan as the head designer. He was most upset about this and in 1961 he sued for compensation and won 48,OOO pounds. When he received this money, he decided to set up his own salon with his good friend Pierre Berge, who is still with him today. Berge became his alter-ego and business manager, enabling Yves to concentrate on designing beautiful clothes without having to worry about the money side of his affairs. In 1962 the house of St. Laurent opened on the rue Spontini In a mansion formerly owned by the painter Forain, and Yves started designing and selling his creations exactly the way he wanted to. He chose not to produce a new silhouette every six months, but derived his collections from a treasure trove of sources like theatre, painting, history, etc. Life Magazine calls his first collection \"the best suits since Chanel.\" In September 1966, the first pret-a-porter Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche shop was opened in Paris, at 21 rue de Toumon, which then moved to 6 Place Saint-Sulpice. 1969 The first London Rive Gauche shop was opened. Catherine Deneuve, the exquisite French actress, is YSL's Muse. She is someone who has worn his clothes since he began, and in 1966 he even designed the costumes worn in her most famous film \"Belle de Jour\". She even today appears in his advertisements for perfume and beauty products. 1969 First mans suit for women, which was to be his leitmotif explicitly evoking memories of Marlene Dietrich. 1970 The denim skirt and film costumes for \"The Siren of Mississipi\". 1971 YSL first Pret-a-Porter collection. 1972 Andy Warhol, the Pop artist paints the famous series of multiple- image portraits of Yves St. Laurent. 1983 The Metropolitan Museum of New York, held an Exhibition displaying 25 years of YSL designs which was a great success. 1989 YSL is the first designer to go public with his house, by putting its shares on the stock exchange. 1993 Merger-cum-takeover of the St. Laurent group by Elf-Sonofi Co. YSL and Pierre Berger continuing artistic control till 2001. In 2002, Yves has reached the age of 65. It is coming up to a half century since he started designing, and his talent is still limitless. But he decided to bid farewell to the world of fashion that he has so loved. January 22nd 2002, was the last couture show of the house of Yves St. Laurent and the house closed after fulfilling the orders from this January show. The doors of YSL Haute Couture atelier on the Avenue Marceau in Paris, finally closed on October 31st 2002. Yves said farewell to all his colleagues and workers. The experienced YSL people have now joined other ateliers, 15 going to Azzedine Alaia and several to Chanel and Jean Paul Gaultier. Saint Laurent, 71, died on 31. Sunday night in March 2008 at his Paris home after a yearlong battle with brain cancer, said Pierre Berge, Saint Laurent's close friend and business partner for four decades. The Gucci Group, which acquired the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house in 1999, said the designer's death \"leaves a great emptiness but also a sublime inheritance.\" \"This genius of creation shattered the codes to create French elegance which today makes Paris a grand capital of fashion,\" Gucci said. President Nicolas Sarkozy praised Saint Laurent for \"putting his mark on a half-century of creation, in luxury as well as ready-to-wear.\" First lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, who graced Saint Laurent's runway during her modeling career, said she had a \"heavy heart\" on learning of his death.","the_look":"One of Yves St. Laurent's greatest talents is colour - from his Mondrian-inspired dresses to his Ballet Russes collections in the 70's.

He repeats what Chanel said, \"Fashions change, Style remains.\" His dream is to give women the foundation of a classic wardrobe, which, by escaping trends, gives them more confidence in themselves. His Smoking (tuxedo) jacket was a shock when it was introduced in 1966. A woman was banned in the 60's from dining at the Plaza hotel in New York, because she was wearing a YSL pantsuit. His pants and jackets became a statement for a new generation of women, and he said \"I want to shock people, force them to think.\" The secret to his style (or styles because there are many) is that he creates clothes that make a woman look great and feel the height of elegance.","who_wears_it":["Everyone from long-standing fans like YSL muse Betty Catroux and Catherine Deneuve","to actresses like Renee Zellweger","Julianne Moore and Chloe Sevigny."],"perfumes":["1964 Y (W)","1971 Yves St. Laurent pour Homme","1971 Rive Gauche","1977 Opium (W)","1981 Kouros for men","1984 Paris","1988 Jazz for men","1990 Live Jazz(W)","1990 Eau de Sport (M)","1993 Champagne (changed to Yvresse in 1996)","1993 Kouros Fraicheur","1993 Jazz Prestige (M)","1996 Yvress Legere (W)","1996 Opium for men","1997 In Love Again (W)","1998 Live Jazz (M)","1999 Vice Versa (W)","1999 Baby Doll (W)","2000 Body Kouros (M)","2001 Nu (W)","2002 Paris L'Eau de Printemps (W)","2002 Paris Premieres Roses (W)","2002 M-7 (M)(The 7th mens fragrance)","2002 Opium Eau d'Ete (W)","2002 Kouros Eau d'Ete (M)","2003 Paris Baby Doll Light (W)","2003 Paris Baby Doll Summer (W)","2003 Nu (M)","2003 Rive Gauche Eau de Toilette (re-issue) (W)","2003 Opium Satin (W)","2003 Kouros Cologne Sport (M)","2003 Rive Gauche pour Homme (M)","2003 Paris Premieres Roses(W)","2004 Paris Roses des Bois (W)","2004 Cinema (W)","2005 Yvresse Legere (W) re-issue","2006 Opium Fleur Imperial Eau d'Orient (W)","2007 Elle (W)","Show Full"],"social_media":"","brands":["Saint Laurent"]}

This precocious talent led her to sell her first creations in her grandmother's haute couture boutique Ginza in Tokyo. By 1972 she had established her own ready-to-wear business, Torii Co. Ltd., and by 1975 had shown her first collection in the prestigious Paris ready-to-wear collections. \n In 1983, two new brands were created, Yuki Torii Deux and Yuki Torii International. Licensed products like scarves, furs, gloves, belts, eyewear, neckties, and umbrellas were produced from the Yuki Torii Design Studio established in 1984. By the following year, the company was operating from both Japan and France when Yuki Torii France S.A. was established, together with the opening of the boutique at 38-40 Galerie Vivienne in Paris.","the_look":"Pattern and color had always excited her, and when she became a professional designer in the early 1960s, her approach always began with the textile or color, with a defined choice of palette that ranged from pastels to brights. These bold, vivid colors have been an enduring and recognizable quality in Torii's work. One distinctive collection was autumn\/winter 1986, which mixed rigorously colored tartans and checks for menswear, womenswear, and childrenswear. The collection consisted of lively, wearable separates; oversize tartan shirts, tartan trousers, and comfortable cardigans for men; long tartan flounced skirts for women, teamed with long, skinny rib jumpers or oversized Argyle patterned sweaters; tartan pinafore dresses for girls and a weather-beaten, mountaineering look for boys, layering tartan over shirts over tartan Levi-style jackets. \nThe vibrant Yuki Torii collection sold as part of Liberty of London's Japan at Liberty promotion in 1991 and displayed a more sophisticated air, paying homage to the style of Coco Chanel combined with the color combinations of Christian Lacroix. Vibrant tweeds in unities of orange, lime green, red, grass green, yellow, pale pink, and fuchsia were made into neat, boxy suits, and separates. Much of the fabric was fringed at the hems of garments, and flower-shaped tweed emblems were interesting details appliqu\u00e9d on pockets and trims.\nTorii has often been told her clothes look best on herself, and it is from this perspective that she begins designing. The approach is similar to that adopted by many other female designers, in particular Jean Muir, who is renowned for producing clothes women really want to wear and feel comfortable in. Torii thinks it natural that female designers conceive ideas from themselves and their roles and needs as women. She likes to project an overall image of sweetness in her clothes, a sweetness retained in images of childrenswear but is often lost in adult fashion. She achieves this by never presenting themes that threaten or provoke controversy. Her look instead is a harmonious combination of contrasting color and fabric that is wearable and flattering but often incorporates the unusual detailing found in children's clothes, for instance, Western cowboy detailing on children's shirts or the naive flower emblems in her tweed collection.\nA continuing theme in Torii's work has been the kimono. Kimonos and obis have been included in her lines and influenced items in her collections for decades. Typically, she bases these designs on the traditional kimono, which is a complicated and rule-governed garment, but adds a flexibility that allows today's women to adapt them to their lifestyle. She also incorporates modern fabrics, such as polyester, which does not wrinkle.\nTorii's haute couture and ready-to-wear similarly feature unique mixes of fabrics and patterns, such as checks with velvet or leather with gold lam\u00e9. Her collections are often critically acclaimed, with the term \"classy\" frequently used. The fashion press and customers alike find them innovative yet wearable. In addition to her collections, Torii designs school uniforms, as well as licensed accessories.","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":["Yuki"]}

{"designer_name":"Yumi Eto","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/yumi-eto\/"],"biography":"The 33-year-old Vancouverite, in business since 1995, has seen her own exclusive couture line become a must-have for well-dressed women in Vancouver, Tokyo and Hollywood. \n In 1995, after training and apprenticing for four years with fashion school owner and couturiere Helen Lefeaux, Eto presented a small but beautifully executed collection of elegant dresses and separates at Holt Renfrew in Vancouver. \n That one-night trunk show was a success. It was an auspicious beginning. Eto took orders for $20,000 worth of couture in one evening. However, Holt Renfrew wasn't ready to sign her up as a regular label. \n   Undaunted she carried on, keeping the focus on the detailed art of her pieces. Three years later she went to New York where she rolled a rack of her designs down the street from her hotel to Barneys. The buyer was overwhelmed by Eto's designs and immediately wrote an order. Then she took Japan. To celebrate the new millennium, the owners of Isetan, one of Tokyo's most prestigious retail stores, conducted a global search for a new collection that would fit with the store's existing labels -- Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs. Isetan was so impressed that, in an unprecedented move, all the windows of the store were devoted to Eto's clothes. It was a deep compliment to her design integrity because it is rare in Japan for a big store to take a chance on a little-known label. To accommodate the large order, it was necessary to find a suitable manufacturer, and one was found in Milan, and the European connection took root. In the United States, her clothes are also carried by Neiman Marcus, where they hang between those of John Galliano and Chloe. The store also features her bridal collection. In January 2001, Eto's company received a boost when Marie-Jeanne Becker-Godard signed on as CEO and provided the financial expertise necessary to help Eto tackle the lucrative ready-to-wear market. Becker-Godard brings considerable management and marketing experience to the fledgling company. She previously had a chain of 85 eponymous cosmetic stores in France. When Bernard Arnault of LVMH (Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton) came knocking at her door, she agreed to sell. At the time, Becker-Godard had been planning to expand her operations on Canada's West Coast. She and her family's Canadian visas had come through, so, despite selling the business, they decided to stay in B.C. Through mutual friends Eto and Becker-Godard were introduced, and the French woman now had a new challenge to thoroughly open the U.S. and Japanese markets then concentrate on Canada. Europe, which she understands well, would follow.","the_look":"Eto's reputation as a designer deserves such care.

His own inventive approach to textiles acted as a catalyst for fashion designers of that time: in 1952 his highly original large-scale floral prints were used by Dior and Schiaparelli, and in 1957 his shaggy mohair inspired Castillo to crate huge enveloping coats. the look 'Zika Ascher is an innovator, the man who introduced the mohair cult, and the flowered prints launched by Christian Dior.'","the_look":"","who_wears_it":[],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}
{"designer_name":"Zoran Ladicorbic","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/zoran-ladicorbic\/"],"biography":"Zoran Ladicorbis was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1947. The designer, who goes by his first name, was trained in his native country as an architect, and a love of geometric shapes and straight lines is evident in his clothing design. \n Zoran came to the United States in 1972. Although he had no formal education in fashion, he worked for the first few years in retail. He was also an accessories designer for the 1970s women's fashion designer, Scott Barrie. \n After a few years, he opened his own business and showed his first collection in 1976. He was using only the best and most luxurious fabrics. Cashmere, satin, velvet, and high-quality wool are staples of his collection. He creates two collections a year, spring and fall, and shows them in his New York loft-workplace located in the downtown SoHo neighborhood. \n   Zoran has kept to this minimalist aesthetic even during the more flamboyant 1980s. In the somewhat more abashed 1990s, his designs have gathered more momentum and his customer base has increased. His designs are not cheap, but he has a loyal following that snaps up his designs year after year. Among the Zoran devotees are model-actresses. His clothes are sold by high-level, slightly avant-garde stores such as Barney's and Henri Bendel in New York, as well as out of his workplace. Zoran believes that his typical customer visits him once a year and buys several thousand dollars' worth of pieces at one time. Like the color palette, the silhouettes vary only slightly from season to season. Core pieces include a cardigan jacket, a T-shirt, crewneck cashmere sweaters, loose trousers, loose shorts, and a sarong skirt, which the designer claims he wore himself for a year to make sure the fit was correct. Zoran resortwear and knitwear collections remained strong sellers throughout the late 1990s. Zoran's minimalist designs, often called \"spare luxury,\" appeal to a select and increasingly visible client\u00e9le. Once hard to come by, Zoran apparel is now available at many high-end department stores, from Ultimo to Henry Bendel, Saks Fifth Avenue to Bergdorf Goodman. Zoran is popular with not only his growing client base, but with his fellow designers as well. When Women's Wear Daily had asked 50 designers in 1996 who should replace the departing Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 at the House of Dior, Fabrizio Ferri perhaps gave Zoran the ultimate compliment: \"The people who wear couture today wear it as a status symbol, rather than because they have style. In 1999, the Chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, told the New York Times, \"Zoran is at the very top\". His annual sales were estimated at $ 25 million wholesale in that year.","the_look":"He is a minimalist designer, cutting luxurious fabrics into precise, simple shapes and avoiding where possible the use of fastenings, decorations and accessories. He has produced a capsule wardrobe consisting of trousers, a cardigan, a top, four T-shirts and several skirts of different lengths. This is intended to answer all travel requirements. \nCashmere is one of his favourite fabrics. \nHe is obsessive about cutting and finishing a garment. His clothes create a feeling of luxury through perfect craftsmanship and materials, not through ostentatious embellishment, bright color, or showy fabrics. He uses the same muted color palette over and over: black and white, ivory, gray, and navy, with an occasional washed-out pastel such as pale pink or celery thrown in to liven the mix.","who_wears_it":["Lauren Hutton","Candice Bergen","Isabella Rossellini","the painter Jennifer Hartley","socialite Amanda Burden","and Tipper Gore","the former U.S. vice-president\u2019s wife."],"perfumes":"","social_media":"","brands":[]}

{"designer_name":"Zandra Rhodes","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/zandra-rhodes\/"],"biography":"194O Zandra Lindsey Rhodes, was born in Kent, England. Zandra Rhodes was introduced to the world of fashion by her mother, who was a fitter in a Paris fashion house and a teacher at Medway College of Art. Zandra studied first at Medway and then at the Royal College of Art in London. Her major area of study was textile design. \n 1961 Entered the Royal College of Art, London. She graduated with first class honours and a special design award in 1964. \n 1964-1967 Taught at the Royal College of Art, while simultaneously designing for a printing works she had set up with friend Alexander McIntyre. \n   1967 Zandra Rhodes became a partner in a boutique called the \"Fulham Road Clothes Shop\" where she designed and made clothes. Her early textile fashion designs were considered too silly by the traditional British manufacturers, so in 1969, she established her own retail outlet in the fashionable Fulham Road in West London. Her very first designs under her own name included chiffon scarves, handkerchief pointed pants, caftans, sheer printed organza jackets and at-home robes. Zandra's own lifestyle has proved to be as dramatic, glamorous and extroverted as her designs. With her bright green hair (later changed to a pink and sometimes a red), theatrical makeup and art jewelry, she has stamped her identity on the international world of fashion. 1970 She added jersey to her collection and revived the crinoline. She also designed turquoise velvet dress which was worn with fur boots. In this year, Voigue magazine gave Zandra a cover, shown on the right here, with her necklace and dress prominently shown. In this year, she created her \"Primavera\" look in handpainted silk chiffon trimmed with feather fronds. 1972 She came out with a collection of day clothes under the label \"Zandra Rhodes II\", which included knitted sweaters, coats and dresses. Zandra also had a knitting studio and upholstery fabric store, and sold tailored coats, furs and lingerie. 1973 Her clothes were chosen by Cecil Beaton, the famous painter and photographer, for his fashion retrospective at the Victorian and Albert Museum. During the 1970's, Zandra designed costumes for the British Rock group Queen. These were really differing from her usual creations, but created a sensation on the stage. 1986 When Diana, Princess of Wales, visited Japan on a state visit, Zandra Rhodes designed a pink and white chiffon dress with a handkerchief hem weighted with glass and pearl beads. Her multi-cultural interests and bold distinctive designs made her a favourite of Princess Diana. 1987 Zandra Rhodes came to India, and presented her collections at Delhi and Bombay, using Indian motives in her own distinctive style. She presented saris that used Indian motives improvised by her. She showed different drapes, one being a chiffon sari draped in a Victorian fashion over a crinoline. Another was a peek-a-boo sari of a circular design with holes cut in the pallav for the arms to go in and then over the head to cover it like a stitched veil. She used Vekatgiri cottons, kanchipuram silks, Maheshwari, organza, chiffon and georgette. Many of her saris were edged with tiny pearls. She had got the saris specially woven by India weavers in Madras. For Autumn 2003, Zandra staged a \"happening\" with live music and a crowd as wild as the shocking pink and yellow walls in her Fashion and Textile Musem in South London. Models in Rhode's signature prints of stylized flowers and new patterns, walked the ramp and vamped it up in filmy ponchos worn with embroidered jeans or brief bikinis. We will try to put some pictures up as soon as possible. Zandra has had two hip replacements in 2001, by the same doctor who had done a similar operation on the Queen Mother. She is now walking OK but plans to last as long as possible. She spends half of her time in the United States, visiting with her long-time partner Salah Hassanein, who lives in San Diego. He is a former President of Warner Brothers International Theatres. Zandra completed a most beloved project in 2003. After 8 years of energy, imagination and persistence, she opened the Museum in what was an old warehouse in London. The first exhibition entitled \"My Favourite Dress\" showed dresses from 70 designers including Armani, Galliano, Lacroix, Missoni, Ungaro, etc. Only one Zandra Rhodes is included, a chiffon 1973 dress. She also included many dresses created by British designers at European houses like McQueen, MacDonald and Phoebe Philo at Chloe. This Museum is one of the MUST SEE fashion stops in London. Zandra was one of 400 invitees (she was the only fashion designer) to a party at Buckingham Palace, held by the Queen and Prince Philip to honour the achievements of British creative icons. Here on the left is a picture of her attending, where she looks rather like Elizabeth I in that gown. The Summer of 2005 seems to be Zandra Rhode's moment. Her face is blown up across the windows of Top Shop store at Oxford Circus and the first London retrospective of her work is on display in the Fashion and Textile Museum she opened two years ago. Joseph Ettedgui has Zandra's dresses in the windows of his London flagship Joseph store, 30 years after he started buying her patterned dresses in the 1970's. Her printed chiffons are as popular today as they were then. On 22 September 2006, she appeared as herself on the long-running BBC Radio 4 soap opera The Archers. Rhodes also appeared, as herself, in an episode of Absolutely Fabulous during the BBC shows second season.","the_look":"She has an outlandish style, her models always wear exaggerated make-up. The eyes and eyebrows are especially noticeable. Rhodes lacked eyebrows herself so she painted them on. The Rhodes aesthetic is gently flattering, flamboyantly feminine and never harsh. \nShe is specially known for her screen printed and hand decorated textiles. Her prints are inspired by drawings, some incident that interests her, or a period in history or even children's book illustrations. \nThe year of her Medieval Pageant collection, her models wore wimples and snoods, in colours plucked from the English countryside. \nShe never restricts herself to working in a regular format. Her designs are free-wheeling and spirited with no beginning, no end, no straight edges and her prints are her own \"particular handwriting\" of wiggly undulating lines. \nShe uses motifs like strange flowers, rock landscapes, red Indian arrows, cactus or lily motifs, lips, lipsticks, teddy bears, zigzag and splashy patterns. \nHer flower fairy collection was named after the fairies in childrens books, like cobweb, honey suckle, pea blossom and almond blossom. It included dresses in tulle embroidered with dew drops, min skating skirts with pink pearls stitched on. \nHer Indian miniature painting collection included Madras plaids and raw silks in colours like jasmine, saffron, persimmon and gold short kohl. Mirror set embroideries in Indian colours were also used. \nHer contraversial \"Conceptual Chic\" collection of 1977, was inspired by the Punks of London, and included ripped, zipped and safety-pin secured dresses. \nHer \"Secrets of the Nile:\" collection, featured plenty of glitter and glitz on chiffon, organza, denim, knitwear, corduroy and jersey. Frills and swirls, narrow and flared garments in colours like turquoise, lilac, star and milky-way cream, navy, silver, brown comet, and maroon sunset. Her favourite colours are vigorously pale shades and prints, often white on white. She enjoys using fabrics like chiffon, organza, metal shimmered silks, chamois and Viyella.","who_wears_it":["Princess Anne","Diana Princess of Wales"],"perfumes":["1994  She introduced her long awaited Perfume \"Zandra Rhodes\" which was a wild and wonderful fragrance."],"social_media":"","brands":["Zandra Rhodes"]}
{"designer_name":"Zac Posen","URL":["https:\/\/www.fashionmodeldirectory.com\/designers\/zac-posen\/"],"biography":"Zac Posen is an American fashion designer. \n Zac Posen was born in Brooklyn in 1980.  Posen was raised in the SoHo neighborhood of lower Manhattan, the Jewish son of artist Stephen Posen and corporate lawyer Susan Posen. His interest in fashion design started early, and as a child he would steal yarmulkes from his grandparents' synagogue to make ball dresses for dolls. \n He attended Saint Ann's School, a private school in Brooklyn, and in his sophomore year interned with fashion designer Nicole Miller. At age 16 he enrolled in the pre-college program at Parsons The New School for Design. He graduated from Saint Ann's in 1999. \n   For three years Posen was mentored by curator Richard Martin at The Costume Institute of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. At 18, he was accepted into the womenswear degree program at London's Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design at the University of the Arts London. During his tenure in London, Posen found that the environment was competitive, while at the same time students were given a wide berth for independent learning. In 2001, Posen constructed a gown entirely made from thin leather strips and dress-maker hooks and eyes that delivered a powerful commentary about the female figure. The gown was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum and featured in their \"Curvaceous\" exhibition. In 2000, Posen received a big break after a dress he made for Naomi Campbell (who had heard about him from Lola Schnabel, the daughter of American artist Julian Schnabel) changed hands several times among several fashion insiders, including actress Paz de la Huerta. He is famously well-connected and has called Lola's sister, Stella Schnabel, his muse. Through Interview magazine Editor-in-Chief Ingrid Sischy, Posen met his future publicist and event producer Ed Filipowski, of KCD who offered to represent him for free. Upon returning to New York in 2001, Posen set up an atelier in his parent\u2019s living room, while they gave him a USD$15 allowance. In October of the same year he was chosen to present a capsule collection as part of GenArt's Fresh Faces in Fashion New York 2001. He received a grant for USD$20,000. After his first runway show in 2001, Posen was courted by fashion titans Yves Carcelle (President of LVMH Fashion Group), Sidney Toledano (Chief Executive Officer and Director of Christian Dior S.A.), and Domenico De Sole (President and Chief Executive Officer of Gucci Group NV.) Following the success of this presentation, Posen established his design studio in Tribeca. Zac Posen continues to receive awards and accolades, most notably the Council of Fashion Designers of America's 2004 Swarovski's Perry Ellis Award for Womenswear. In 2004, rapper and clothing designer Sean Combs made an investment deal with Posen. Ashley Olsen interned with Posen in 2005 while a student at The Gallatin School of Individualized Study, an undergraduate college within New York University. In April 2008, Posen's capsule collection created in collaboration with Target, Zac Posen for Target, was released in 75 stores in Australia. A preview of the collection was shown during March's L'Oreal Melbourne Fashion Festival as one of the fashion week's headline catwalks.","the_look":"Draped, anatomically seamed construction.
