The product was two years in the making, during which time they created the first prototypes – one drawstring bucket and one top-handle horizontal tote. They took traditional vegetable tanned leather – a material mostly used in men’s accessories – coloured the interior and experimented with techniques such as silk screening leather at Mansur’s barn in Santa Monica.\n\nAfter making samples in LA and NYC, they settled on Italy as the production base for their bonded leather bags. They compiled a spreadsheet of where they wanted to be stocked and with $100, shot their first lookbook and booked a booth at the capsule trade show in New York in February 2013. Their bags were picked up by reputable American independent boutiques including Bird and Creatures of Comfort, but it was Gavriel’s chance encounter with designer, showroom operator and multi-brand boutique owner Steven Alan at an art gallery in New York that got them going.\n\nTheir debut collection hit stores in early June 2013 and within weeks blogger, Garance Doré professed her love for the large black bucket bag lined in a shade of red the duo called Flamma.

Unapologetic glamour, fluidly applied onto the female form with an Italian man’s sensibilities, has come to be Cavalli’s signature style.\n\nCavalli was born in Florence, Tuscany. His grandfather, Giuseppe Rossi, was a member of the Macchiaioli Movement, whose work is exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery. Cavalli decided to enrol at the local Art Institute, concentrating in textile print. While still a student, he made a series of flower prints on knit that caught the attention of major Italian hosiery factories.\n\nIn the early 1970s, he invented and patented a revolutionary printing procedure on leather, and he started creating patchworks of different materials. He debuted these techniques in Paris, immediately getting commissions from the likes of Hermès and Pierre Cardin. At age 30, he presented his first namesake collection at the Salon for Prêt-à-Porter in Paris. He brought it to the catwalks of the Sala Bianca of Palazzo Pitti in Florence, and later on those of Milano Collezioni, jeans made of printed denim, intarsia leathers, brocade and wild prints. He opened his first boutique in 1972 in Saint-Tropez.\n\nIn 1980 Cavalli married Eva Düringer, his companion and business partner. In Milan in 1994 Cavalli presented the first sand-blasted jeans. By December of the same year he had opened boutiques in Saint Barth in the French Caribbean, followed by another in Venice. Besides the main line, which is sold in over fifty countries worldwide, Roberto Cavalli designs RC Menswear, the youth-aimed line Just Cavalli, launched in 1998 and comprising  menswear, womenswear and accessories, perfumes, underwear and beachwear. There is also Angels & Devils, a children’s collection, and the Class line. \n\nIn 2002 Cavalli opened his first café-store in Florence, revamping it with his signature animal prints. This was shortly followed by the opening in Milan of the Just Cavalli café at Torre Branca, and another boutique on Via della Spiga.\n\nDespite growth in sales, in 2014 Cavalli's namesake brand started posting annual losses, primarily due to poor debt provision. The family went on to sell a 90 percent stake in the company to Clessidra, an investor focused on Italian businesses in 2015. The company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2019 and later that year it was bought by Dubai-based real estate devloper Vision Investment Co.

Even if it’s twelve centimetres high it still has to feel secure – and that’s a question of balance.

More recently, in June 2018, Blahnik announced the launch of a men's shoe boutique in London, with the aim of making men’s 20 percent of his business, and revealed plans for his first free-standing Paris store in October of the same year. \n\nBlahnik has won numerous awards. The CFDA honoured him in 1987, 1990 and 1998.

The designer was also an impressive linguist, versed in German, English, French and Spanish.\n\nThe son of a wealthy Hamburg businessman, Lagerfeld was born in Germany. Initially educated at St Anne’s school, following his family’s emigration to France Lagerfeld completed his education at Lycée Montaigne, where he focused on drawing and history.\n\nLagerfeld was hired as Pierre Balmain's assistant after winning the coats category in a design competition sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat in 1955. In 1958, after three years at Balmain, he moved to Jean Patou where was involved in the design of ten haute couture collections. Following a brief stint at Tiziano, a couture house based in Rome, Lagerfeld began to freelance for French fashion house Chloé in 1964. At first Lagerfeld designed a few pieces each season, but soon he was designing the entire collection. In 1965, he began a short design collaboration with Curiel, following which he began his collaboration with Fendi.\n\nIn 1982, the chairman of Chanel, Alain Wertheimer, asked Lagerfeld to design for the house. Lagerfeld told The New York Times, “Everybody said, ‘Don’t touch it, it’s dead, it will never come back.’ But by then I thought it was a challenge.” The designer would go on to redefine the house’s codes while paying homage to the Chanel herself, subverting her ideals with his own modern take on her most renowned designs.\n\nLagerfeld has made cult items of the house’s bouclé tweed, pearls, dual-toned footwear and interlocking C’s for new generations around the globe. In recent years, Lagerfeld conceived Chanel’s métiers d’art, runway shows designed to highlight the craftsmanship of houses such as Desrues, Lessage and Barrie Knitwear, now owned under Chanel’s Parraffection umbrella.\n\nThe designer founded his own line, Karl Lagerfeld, in 1984, telling Vogue, “I’ve not been dreaming all my life to have my name over a shop. Now, we’ll put it there because it’s the right moment to do it; and I made this name, why not use it?” Lagerfeld sold the brand to the Tommy Hilfiger group in 2005. He remained its chief creative and was directly involved in the design process.\n\nIn addition to his design talents, Lagerfeld was also a photographer and filmmaker, and regularly brought Chanel’s heritage to life through film and imagery; he also shot and creatively directed all of Chanel’s advertising.

Growing up finding inspiration from the only two fashion magazines available, Feminine Worker and Countryside Woman, Sergeenko sewed her own clothes and won recognition for her design abilities during school. Though a philosophy graduate, Sergeenko continued her design practices, gradually finding tailors to collaborate with upon moving to Moscow a few years later. \n\nFollowing her marriage to billionaire oligarch Danil Khachaturov, Sergeenko became a key couture client of Valentino, Givenchy, Jean Paul Gaultier , Chanel, and her favourite, John Galliano at Dior, introducing her to the fashion industry. She first gained renown as a show attendee, photographed by Tommy Ton alongside other members of the Russian fashion pack, or the ‘Czarinas’ as they came to be known. Sergeenko would often ask Moscow designers to create looks to her specifications, looks the designers would then feature in their collections, leaving Sergeenko frustrated and motivated to seek her due recognition.When her style caught on among friends and the like, Sergeenko eventually took up a recommendation to launch her own brand in 2011. Years later, Sergeenko has dressed an impressive roster of celebrities including Beyoncé and Nicole Kidman, racking up a dense network of Russian production links, based on the aim to promote Russian craftsmanship traditions such as Elets and Vologda lace among other handmade embroidery techniques. \n\nHer couture collections are largely informed by her childhood in Kazakhstan during the Soviet era, her feminine silhouettes often reminiscent of the soviet fashion magazines of the 50s. Her efforts were recognised by the Paris High Fashion Syndicate, which appointed her as an official participant of its Paris High Fashion Week. Sergeenko’s brand is the first Russian brand of its kind to join the event. In 2018, an Ulyana Sergeenko couture exhibition was staged at the Hotel d’Evreux in Paris, and her Autumn/Winter collection was shown in the Russian Embassy in Paris. Sergeenko has also designed gowns for the international ballet star Sergei Polunin, opened a pop-up store in the Russian Seasons Gallery and debuted her 2019 Spring/Summer collection at the opening night of Galeries Lafayette in Doha, in 2019.\n\nSergeenko  is represented by elite fashion publicist Karla Otto and has a team of 65 in Russia, where the collection is designed and produced. Alongside her creative endeavours, the designer also part-takes in cultural exchange projects between Qatar and Russia such as the Love Ball Arabia charity event. \n\nIn 2018, Sergeenko briefly came under media fire for a bouquet of flowers sent to fashion and lifestyle digital magazine CEO and long-time friend, Miroslava Duma , with a handwritten note quoting a suggestively racist song lyric.

His signature oversized silhouettes in black often feature drapery in varying textures.\n\nBorn in Tokyo, Yamamoto graduated from Keio University with a degree in law in 1966. His mother was a dressmaker who had a shop in in Kabukicho (an amusement and entertainment district in Tokyo’s Shinjuku). After graduating, he realised a law career was not for him. “I didn’t want to join the ordinary society,” he told BoF. “So I told my mother after graduation…I want to help you.” Yamamoto’s mother agreed to let him work at her shop, saying he could learn from the sewing assistants. At her request, he also enrolled at Bunka Fashion College, now famous for training designers including Kenzo Takada, Junya Watanabe and Yamamoto himself.\n\nAfter graduating from Bunka, he received a prize to go to Paris for a year, but it was back in Japan that Yamamoto began to discover his true voice as a designer. He set up a small ready-to-wear company that slowly acquired buyers in all the major cities in Japan. The success turned his thoughts back to Paris, and at the beginning of the 1980s Yamamoto returned to the French capital to open his first shop.\n\nSince then, Yamamoto has developed a dedicated global following. His two main lines Yohji Yamamoto and Y's are stocked in high-end department stores worldwide and, in 2007, clocked sales above $100 million, according to the company. Yamamoto's other lines include Pour Homme, Costume d'Homme and Regulation Yohji Yamamoto.\n\nYamamoto has also collaborated with a number of brands, including Adidas (Y-3), Hermès, Mikimoto and Mandarina Duck; and with artists such as Tina Turner, Sir Elton John, Placebo, Takeshi Kitano, Pina Bausch and Heiner Müller.\n\nPoor decisions by finance managers pushed the brand into debts of more than $65 million in 2009, which angered Yamamoto and led to a company restructuring. The private equity firm Integral Corp restructured Yohji Yamamoto Inc. and by November 2010 the company was out of debt.\n\nYamamoto has been recognised for his contributions to fashion with awards including the Chevalier of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon, the Ordre national du Mérite, the Royal Designer for Industry and the Master of Design award by Fashion Group International.", "location": "Japan", "careers": [{"jobTitle": "Designer", "timePeriod": "1981 - Present", "employer": "Yohji Yamamoto"}], "education": [{"timePeriod": null, "description": null, "profile": {"profileId": "2002", "title": "Bunka Fashion College", "slug": "bunka-fashion-college", "isLinkable": true, "profileThumbnail": {"imageUrl": "https://prod-bof-media.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/import/filestack/avatar/profile_avatar.jpeg", "arcAuthKey": "b71bf774a6e9d81ea1c35480e6c3b32bd434dfcf81907bfdcd7b21687b425869", "backgroundColor": "#cdcdcd", "__typename": "ProfileThumbnail"}, "__typename": "OrganisationProfile"}, "__typename": "Education"}, {"timePeriod": null, "description": null, "profile": {"profileId": "1485736414295494", "title": "Keio University", "slug": "keio-university", "isLinkable": false, "profileThumbnail": null, "__typename": "OrganisationProfile"}, "__typename": "Education"}], "socialLinks": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohji_Yamamoto", "http://www.yohjiyamamoto.co.jp/", "https://twitter.com/YohjiYamamoto", "https://www.facebook.com/yamamotoyohji", "http://www.linkedin.com/company/yohji-yamamoto-inc."]}

Much of her early career was spent at British high street favourite Whistles, where she eventually became buying and design director.

Ruby graduated from the Pennsylvania College of Art and Design in 1996, then graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago in 2002 and attended the MFA programme at the Art Centre College of Design in Pasadena, California. Growing up in rural Pennsylvania, Ruby would play with his mother’s sewing machine, a hobby that would lead to a collaboration with Raf Simons in 2014 for a Fall/Winter menswear collection that birthed the bleached-denim signature style that now largely informs Ruby’s own designs. In 2017, Ruby was instrumental in redesigning Calvin Klein ’s New York flagship boutique, bringing in paint-splashed interiors created by the artist.\n\nThe idea for Ruby’s line stems from the one-of-a-kind pieces he wore when working in his studio.

In 1950, aged 18, De la Renta left his native Santo Domingo to study art at The Academy of San Fernando in Madrid. After sketching for a variety of design houses, he secured an internship with Spain’s greatest couturier, Cristóbal Balenciaga.\n\nDe la Renta soon travelled to Paris to become a couture design assistant at Lanvin. Within two years, he had moved to New York and joined the Elizabeth Arden, on the advice of the then editor of American Vogue, Diana Vreeland, who told De la Renta “go to Arden because you will make your reputation faster. She is not a designer, so she will promote you. At the other place, you will always be eclipsed by the name of Dior.”\n\nIt proved sage advice. De la Renta began his own signature ready-to-wear label in 1965.\n\nThe label was an immediate hit thanks to De la Renta’s use of colour, his vibrant prints and romantic rendering of Spanish and Caribbean silhouettes. The success of his line led to the launch of a perfume in 1977, as well as expansion into diffusion and bridal lines later in his career. Between 1993 and 2002 De la Renta designed the haute couture collections for Balmain, becoming the first Dominican to design for a French couture house. \n\nHighly respected by his contemporaries, de la Renta served as president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America from 1973 to 1976, and from 1986 to 1988.", "location": "United States", "careers": [{"jobTitle": null, "timePeriod": "1993 - 2002", "employer": "Balmain"}, {"jobTitle": "Designer", "timePeriod": "1965 - Present", "employer": "Oscar de la Renta"}], "education": [{"timePeriod": null, "description": null, "profile": {"profileId": "1485736411192631", "title": "Academy of San Fernando", "slug": "academy-of-san-fernando", "isLinkable": false, "profileThumbnail": null, "__typename": "OrganisationProfile"}, "__typename": "Education"}], "socialLinks": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_De_La_Renta", "http://www.oscardelarenta.com/", "https://twitter.com/OscarPRGirl", "http://instagram.com/oscarprgirl", "https://www.facebook.com/oscardelarenta", "http://oscarprgirl.tumblr.com/", "http://pinterest.com/oscarprgirl/", "http://www.youtube.com/user/OscardelaRentaTV", "http://www.linkedin.com/company/oscar-de-la-renta"]}

The designer has not only called upon Brazilians to support local creatives but is outspoken about social and environmental issues. Through Misci, which rejects the traditional fashion cycle, Martin raises funds for tribal communities fighting for the Amazon rainforest’s protection, and supports a network of certified local producers of materials like silk, hemp and arapaima leather as well as cooperatives maintaining a lower carbon footprint.\n\nBorn and raised by his mother and grandmother in Sinop, Mato Grosso, Martin pursued more conventional careers in law and medicine before studying design at São Paulo’s European Institute of Design. He worked as a furniture designer before pivoting to fashion and in 2018 launching his brand Misci, a reference to a Portuguese term that draws on the diverse ethnic heritage that he and many other Brazilians share. The brand’s profile soared in Brazil after Martin’s work was worn by the first lady on national television, and rose overseas after Oprah famously purchased three of his Bambolê handbags at his boutique during her visit to São Paulo.

Having been at the helm of the Versace empire as artistic director since 1997, she has overseen the growth of the group’s luxury clothing lines alongside the expansion into accessories, home furnishings and hotels, creating a luxury lifestyle brand which was forecast to hit $850 million in revenue in 2018. In 2018, the Versace company was acquired by Michael Kors Holdings — now rebranded Capri Holdings — for a value of $2.1 billion. Donatella and her family now own €150 million ($176 million) in group stock.\n\nAs both artistic director and vice president of the board, she is responsible for the overall vision of the house, from its catwalk collections and image, to its global growth and future in the digital world.\n\nHow has Donatella Versace shaped the Versace fashion brand?\n\nThe larger-than-life mogul is credited with having retained a coveted status for the Atelier Versace and ready-to-wear lines. She debuted her first collection for Atelier Spring/Summer 1998 on a see-through catwalk held over the swimming pool at the Ritz Hotel in Paris which resulted in instant acclaim from industry insiders.\n\nDonatella Versace has also overseen the repositioning of the Versus line, appointing Christopher Kane in 2009 to revive the brand, followed in 2012 by Jonathan Anderson, who designed a capsule collection for the label. In 2013, Versace announced that Anthony Vaccarello would be the latest designer to produce a capsule collection for the label. The success of this saw Vaccarello hired as Versus Versace's permanent creative director and the line more than double its year-on-year revenues in 2014 — he departed in 2016.\n\nWho is Donatella Versace’s family?\n\nShe is the youngest of four children. Her father, Antonio, was a salesman and her mother, Francesca, was a dressmaker. Her older brother Gianni opened the first Versace boutique in Milan's Via della Spiga in 1978, and it quickly became a sensation. Versace soon became one of the hottest fashion brands of the moment, and Gianni employed his sister Donatella as Vice President, overseeing creative oversight, where she acted as a key consultant to Versace.\n\nVersace was shot and killed on 15 July 1997, at the age of 50, on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion as he returned from a morning walk on Ocean Drive. In the aftermath of the highly publicised manhunt, most of the Versace family, including Donatella, moved temporarily to a secluded private resort in the Caribbean. Three days after Gianni’s death, Donatella Versace mounted her first haute couture show for the label at the Hôtel Ritz Paris.\n\nDoes Donatella Versace have a husband and children?\n\nVersace and her former husband, American model Paul Beck have two children: daughter Allegra Versace Beck (born 30 June 1986), and son Daniel Versace (born 1989). upon Gianni's death her daughter Allegra inherited 50 percent of the label.\n\nDonatella Versace’s accolades and awards.\n\nIn 2008 Versace was appointed as an honorary chair of London’s Fashion Fringe initiative founded by acclaimed journalist Colin McDowell. An active philanthropist, Versace serves as patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation and in 2010 was awarded a “Do Something” award by VH1 for her contributions to charitable work. In December 2017, Donatella Versace was awarded with the “Fashion Icon” award during the Fashion Awards, while in 2018 she won the International award at the CFDA. That same year she was honoured as “Designer of the Year” both by British GQ and by GQ China, and awarded the “Fashion Icon Award” at the GQ Awards in Berlin. She has also received the CNMI Award in recognition of sustainability at the Green Carpet Fashion Awards in 2018.\n\nDonatella Versace’s top celebrity partnerships, friendships and collaborations.\n\nThe designer is notable in the celebrity scene, taking after her brother Gianni, credited with inventing the supermodel vogue of the 1990s, by discovering and featuring major supermodels like Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista, all of whom he featured both on the runway and in his ad campaigns.\n\nShe has designed advertising campaigns for Versace that included Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Courtney Love, Christina Aguilera, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Demi Moore, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga and. Other examples of collaborations include:\n\n*   Jennifer Lopez: Versace’s popularity grew when she designed the Green Versace dress of Jennifer Lopez, also known as the \"Jungle-Dress\", which was worn by Jennifer Lopez at the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, and then again at the label’s Spring/Summer 2020 show, creating an Instagram sensation.\n*   Kim Kardashian: She also counts Kim Kardashian as a fan, wearing many pieces from the brand’s archive, and created her dress for the 2018 Met Gala.", "location": "Italy", "careers": [{"jobTitle": "Artistic Director & Vice President", "timePeriod": null, "employer": "Versace"}], "education": null, "socialLinks": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatella_Versace", "http://www.versace.com/", "https://twitter.com/Versace", "https://www.facebook.com/versace", "http://pinterest.com/versaceofficial/", "http://www.youtube.com/user/versacevideos", "http://www.linkedin.com/company/versace"]}

The two share equal responsibility for creative-decision making and will showcase their first Spring/Summer 2021 womenswear collection in September 2020 in Milan. Before that, Simons was creative officer at Calvin Klein until he left in December 2018, less than two years after taking up the post. \n\nPreviously, the Belgian designer brought Dior to the forefront of modernity with his innovative approaches to design across ready-to-wear, accessories and haute couture. Prior to his appointment at the Parisian house, Simons spent seven years as creative director for Jil Sander.\n\nSimons originally graduated in Industrial Design and Furniture Design in 1991, going on to work as a furniture designer for various galleries. Encouraged by Linda Loppa , head of the fashion department at the Antwerp Royal Academy, the self-taught Belgian designer launched the Raf Simons label, which began as a youth culture line, in 1995. Today, innovation, modernity and individuality remain core tenets of his menswear line, and the creative fusion of the arts the Raf Simons brand is known for — music, performance and art has always played a substantial role in the designer's creative process — is an approach he has replicated at the different houses he has headed up. In 2008, two flagship Raf Simons standalone stores opened in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, in collaboration with the artists Sterling Ruby and Roger Hiorns. Since then, Simons has created collaborative collections with Fred Perry , Asics, Adidas and Linda Farrow.\n\nIn June, 2005 Simons was appointed the creative director of Jil Sander , receiving industry-wide acclaim for his minimalist work at the German label. The diffusion line Jil Sander Navy was launched during his tenure.\n\nSimons left Jil Sander in time for his appointment to Dior in April 2012, replacing Bill Gaytten as creative director and ending a period of transition after John Galliano 's dismissal from the role. During his time at the house, Simons established his own modern yet elegant take on Dior’s archive of classic silhouettes. In 2015, Simons cast Rihanna as the first black face of the house; the same year, \"Dior & I\" — a documentary by Frédéric Tcheng exploring the house's couture atelier and the creation of Simon's first Haute Couture collection at Dior — was released to rave reviews.\n\nIn October 2015, he stepped down from his position at Dior to shift his focus to his Raf Simons label. It wasn’t until the following August, after ongoing industry speculation, that the designer was officially announced as chief creative officer of Calvin Klein. Relocating to New York, Simons was tasked with leading the creative vision at the iconic American brand, where his debut collection for the label received critical acclaim. He stepped down from the role in December 2018.\n\nSimons has been honoured with the Swiss Textiles Award, which he received in November 2003, and the 2011 presidency of the Hyères International Festival of Fashion and Photography jury. In 2017 he was awarded both the Menswear Designer of the Year and Womenswear Designer of the Year Award, and the following year he won the Womenswear Designer of the Year again. In October 2000, the designer was named head professor of the Fashion Department at Vienna's University of Applied Arts, a position he held until June 2005. He also presented a retrospective installation — \"Florence Calling: Raf Simons\" — at Pitti Uomo in June 2016, and showed a textile collection at Salone del Mobile in Milan. The designer’s work was also featured in an exhibition entitled “1989-2019: Thirty Years of Men’s Fashion” in Florence in 2019.", "location": "Belgium", "careers": [{"jobTitle": "Chief Creative Officer", "timePeriod": "2016 - 2018", "employer": "Calvin Klein"}, {"jobTitle": "Creative Director", "timePeriod": "2012 - 2015", "employer": "Christian Dior Couture"}, {"jobTitle": "Creative Director", "timePeriod": "2005 - 2012", "employer": "Jil Sander"}, {"jobTitle": "Designer", "timePeriod": "1994 - Present", "employer": "Raf Simons"}], "education": null, "socialLinks": ["https://www.instagram.com/rafsimons", "http://rafsimons.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/RAF-SIMONS-OFFICIAL-316047143236/"]}

The rapid succession of orders continued and by the late ‘70s von Furstenberg had sold her dress design license to Puritan Fashions Corporation and in 1983 sold the cosmetics line to Beecham Pharmaceuticals, effectively ending her control over the DVF company name.\n\nIn 1997, following a tenure in Paris founding a publishing company, acting as a contributing editor to Vanity Fair and entering into a creative partnership with TV sales channel QVC, von Furstenberg reacquired the licences and re-ignited interest in her brand and iconic wrap dress.\n\nAn active philanthropist, von Furstenberg sits on the board of Vital Voices, an organisation that empowers emerging women leaders and social entrepreneurs, and also serves as a Director of The Diller – von Furstenberg Family Foundation, through which  the designer has donated to several important causes.\n\nVon Furstenberg has published a series of books throughout her career including the \"Book of Beauty: How to Become a More Attractive, Confident, and Sensual Woman\" in 1977, the \"Bed, Bath and Table\" series and \"Diane: A Signature Life.\" The designer was also the subject of a travelling exhibition curated by André Leon Talley entitled \"The Journey of a Dress.\"", "location": "United States", "careers": [{"jobTitle": "Designer and Founder", "timePeriod": "1974 - Present", "employer": "Diane von Furstenberg"}], "education": [{"timePeriod": null, "description": null, "profile": {"profileId": "1485736392287808", "title": "University of Geneva", "slug": "university-of-geneva", "isLinkable": false, "profileThumbnail": null, "__typename": "OrganisationProfile"}, "__typename": "Education"}], "socialLinks": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_von_Fürstenberg", "http://www.dvf.com/", "http://pinterest.com/dvf/", "http://www.youtube.com/dvf", "http://www.linkedin.com/company/diane-von-furstenberg", "https://www.facebook.com/dvf"]}

Since then, Mr van Noten has maintained his independent spirit, and has been maintaining the creative integrity of his design process and aesthetic. An independently-financed designer, in June 2018 Van Noten sold a majority stake of his namesake business to Spanish group Puig. The designer remains the chief creative officer and chairman of the brand.\n\nVan Noten is the third generation of his family to work within fashion; both his father and grandfather were tailors. In 1970 his father opened a boutique on the outskirts of Antwerp selling Emmanuel Ungaro, Salvatore Ferragamo and Ermenegildo Zegna. His father’s business took Van Noten to the menswear shows in Milan, Düsseldorf, and Paris, experiences that taught him both the commercial and technical sides of the industry, and prompted his realisation that he was much more interested in design. In 2007, Van Noten opened his first Paris boutique for women, opening his next location in Tokyo two years later, following the expansion into menswear via another store in Paris.\n\nVan Noten has six stand alone stores, including a five-storey former department store in Antwerp. His collection is sold in over 500 wholesale doors around the world. The scale of his business is particularly impressive given that the designer does not advertise.\n\nHe won the CFDA International Designer of the Year Award and the distinction of \"Royal Designer for Industry\" by the London-based RSA Trustee Board in 2008, and received the honour of Officier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in July 2014. An exhibition at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris featuring his designs and influences opened that same year. Van Noten also holds the Flemish Royal Academy of Belgium's Gold Medal and the Couture Council of the Museum at FIT New-York's Couture Council Award for Artistry of Fashion.\n\nIn 2014, the Parisian Musée des Arts Décoratifs staged the exhibition featuring Van Noten's designs, moving to Antwerp in 2015. In 2016, Van Noten won the Culture Award of the Province of Antwerp for his cultural contribution, dressing the Belgian Queen, various actors for awards and renowned contemporary as well as classical dancers for performances.", "location": "Belgium", "careers": [{"jobTitle": "Designer", "timePeriod": "1986 - Present", "employer": "Dries Van Noten"}], "education": [{"timePeriod": null, "description": null, "profile": {"profileId": "923", "title": "Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp", "slug": "royal-academy-of-fine-arts-antwerp", "isLinkable": true, "profileThumbnail": {"imageUrl": "https://prod-bof-media.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/import/filestack/avatar/profile_avatar.jpeg", "arcAuthKey": "b71bf774a6e9d81ea1c35480e6c3b32bd434dfcf81907bfdcd7b21687b425869", "backgroundColor": "#cdcdcd", "__typename": "ProfileThumbnail"}, "__typename": "OrganisationProfile"}, "__typename": "Education"}], "socialLinks": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dries_Van_Noten", "http://www.driesvannoten.be/", "https://twitter.com/DriesVanNoten", "http://instagram.com/driesvannoten", "https://www.facebook.com/driesvannoten"]}

In April 2015, Palace opened its first monobrand store in London’s Soho and has since expanded into the US market with the opening of a New York boutique in May 2017. Aside from launching four seasonal collections a year, Palace has found growth by collaborating with a roster of brands and artists including Reebok, Umbro, Ralph Lauren , Adidas and Reebok. In its city of origin, Palace is stocked by Dover Street Market and End Clothing, and operates its own Brewer Street store. Palace also runs three other monobrand stores in New York City, Tokyo and Los Angeles.\n\nQuick growth and resulting popularity saw the brand receive recognition as the \"European Skate Brand of the Year\" in 2012 at the Bright Tradeshow awards in Berlin, and a nomination for the Fashion Award's Urban Luxe award, ranking among the likes of streetwear megabrands Off-White and Supreme.", "location": "United Kingdom", "careers": [{"jobTitle": "Founder", "timePeriod": "2009 - Present", "employer": "Palace"}], "education": null, "socialLinks": ["http://www.palaceskateboards.com"]}

Soon after, Serre developed an interest in fashion, attending a specialist visual arts school. This was partly thanks to her grandfather, a collector and second-hand dealer who taught Serre the value of vintage. His influence sparked her motive for attending the La Cambre Mode(s) Belgian Fashion Design academy, graduating with highest honours in 2016, as she indented to recreate her large collection of vintage clothing she had gathered over the years. \n\nSerre held internships working under Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen , Matthieu Blazy at Maison Margiela and Raf Simons at Dior, before scoring a year-long junior designer position at Balenciaga, working with Demna Gvasalia . Whilst at Balenciaga, she also worked on her eponymous label. Her graduate collection also piqued the interest of the Parisian concept store, A Broken Arm, which put her pieces on a pedestal alongside the likes of Céline and Margiela, selling out quickly.\n\nIn 2017, the Paris-based designer’s fifth-year graduate collection, “Radical Call for Love,” was shortlisted for the Hyères Festival, the ANDAM Prize and the LVMH Prize, ultimately winning the latter, as the youngest designer ever to do so.. The judging panel, that included Karl Lagerfeld and Pheobe Philo, was drawn to Serre’s athletic and futuristic style, blended in form-fitting designs that featured her signature crescent moon print. Since her official debut at the Autumn/Winter 2018 show, the designer has shown three collections at Paris Fashion Week which have featured technologically-forward designs incorporating anti-pollution masks. Working with materials that have no inherent value such as old jeans, recycled fabrics and bedsheets, around 50% of silhouettes in her “Green Line” collection were recycled fabrics.\n\nShe has since garnered a cult following for blurring the lines between ready-to-wear, couture, tailoring and sportswear, including Ariana Grande who donned a Marine Serre jumpsuit and crescent-moon boots for one of her shows. In 2019, Serre released her first men’s collection featuring tie-dyed silk sweatshirts made of upcycled materials. \n\nThe label is stocked by Dover Street Market , Barneys New York and Browns as well as e-tailers Matches Fashion, Farfetch and Ssense.", "location": "France", "careers": null, "education": null, "socialLinks": ["https://marineserre.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/marineserre.official/", "https://www.instagram.com/marineserre_official/"]}

Ghesquière's sharp aesthetic and innovative craftsmanship at Vuitton has placed the label squarely at the forefront of the industry.\n\nPrior to joining Vuitton, Ghesquière spent a total of 15 years at Balenciaga, a once ailing womenswear house which he transformed into one of the most forward-thinking luxury brands in the world (and the most exclusive and sought-after ticket at Paris Fashion Week) with his complex vision, sculptural tailoring and use of ultra-modern fabrics.\n\nRaised in the small town of Loudun in western France, Ghesquière announced at the age of 12 that he wanted to be a designer, though he admits this was partly from an adolescent desire to do something different from his parents and to alleviate boredom. At 14, he got an internship with French designer Agnès B for which he was paid in clothes.\n\nHe worked from 1990 to 1992 as an assistant to designer Jean-Paul Gaultier . He then worked at Pôles, designing their knitwear line followed by a series of assignments with different companies including the Italian house of Callaghan. Prior to his appointment as Balenciaga’s creative director (a position left vacant following the dismissal of Belgian Josephus Thimister) Ghesquière designed funeral clothes for the brand under a license for the Japan market.\n\nIn 2001, the same year that Ghesquière was named Womenswear Designer of the Year by the CFDA, the Gucci Group bought Balenciaga, a move that Ghesquière welcomed. “It is a happy relationship,” he said at the time. “It has worked because they wanted me to explain what I wanted to do with Balenciaga, not the other way around.”\n\nThings later soured with Gucci Group’s owners PPR (now Kering) and, in November 2012, Ghesquière and PPR parted ways in what was an acrimonious separation.\n\nOn November 4, 2013, Ghesquiére was announced as Louis Vuitton's new artistic director — just weeks after Marc Jacobs had announced his retirement from the house. \"Louis Vuitton has always incarnated for me the symbol of ultimate luxury, innovation and exploration,\" Ghesquiére said. \"I am very honoured of the mission that I am entrusted with, and proud to join the history of this great maison.

He has flown somewhat under the radar but, following his ready-to-wear debut in Autumn/Winter 2013, a collaboration with La Redoute and his nomination as an ANDAM finalist, Kayrouz was set to breakout into wide renown.\n\nKayrouz fled to Paris following his country’s civil war. As a result, at just 16 years old he began studying at L’École de La Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Pairsienne. Following his graduation from the school, Kayrouz completed stints at both Chanel and Christian Dior Couture, before returning to his native country, which was then at peace. Once home, he began crafting couture like wedding dresses for friends. His designs soon led to him being called upon to create for Beirut's high society and Middle Eastern royalty.\n\nIn 2009, the designer established Maison Rabih Kayrouz and was invited by the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne to become a correspondent member. Speaking at the time of his selection to the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, Kayrouz told The National,  \"A young Lebanese designer wanting to do something international, because my idea is not only to show a couture collection, it is to show a collection that has different techniques. For me, this is the future of couture. Usually, you differentiate between couture and ready-to-wear. But here, with me, it's not that. This is a collection that has different techniques. And I think this concept was quite exciting for them.”\n\nThree years later he would launch his ready-to-wear line. “I believe in couture as a means of expression,” the designer told Fashionista. “It’s free, it’s about emotion, about dreaming. When I make ready-to-wear, I keep the emotion and dreamy aspect of couture. I’ve always wanted to create for the pleasure of women, I love that clothes can be either protective or seducing, when women play different roles.”\n\nKayrouz said to The National, “You have haute couture, which is very dreamy and beautiful, and you can go to the shows and dream for nights after that. Or you have ready-to-wear, which is OK, it's about brands and they do what they exhibit and they sell. But now, we have a new generation of people who are interested in keeping the handicraft and the savoir faire of couture, but who are also interested in making them more accessible.”\n\nHis beliefs expressed in 2009 have been proven by the onset of more and more wearable couture, and increasing amounts of demi-couture being produced each year. Kayrouz continues to beat his own path, and sees fashion follow.

In 2015, he won a BFC/GQ Fashion Fund grant and opened his first flagship for E. Tautz, on London’s Duke Street, around the corner from the 19th century label’s original store on Oxford Street.\n\nWith no formal training in fashion, he studied material sciences and engineering but launched himself into the industry while he was still in the middle of his MBA at Saïd Business School at Oxford. In 2005, he saw an advert in the FT for the sale of Norton & Sons, a tailor established in 1821 that had once dressed Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock and Kaiser Wilhelm I. Mortgaging everything he owned, Grant bought the company on a whim.\n\nBy dragging the tailor into the 21st century, Grant was able to pull it back to profitability. Bespoke business had tripled by 2011 and Grant was making his mark in the menswear world. Norton & Sons has since created tailored catwalk looks for the likes of Christopher Kane and Henry Holland.\n\nIn 2009, Grant expanded into ready-to-wear with the re-launch of another traditional London tailor, the then-defunct E. Tautz who once made clothes for Winston Churchill. A year later, Grant was awarded menswear designer of the year at the British Fashion Awards. Since then, Norton & Sons and E. Tautz have grown to have a turnover of more than £1 million (around $1.55 million) each year, and E. Tautz has collaborated with Christian Louboutin , Barbour and J Crew.\n\nIn 2013, Grant was made an Honorary Professor at Glasgow Caledonian University’s School of Business and Society, in 2016, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) while in 2017, he was awarded an honorary degree by Heriot-Watt University.\n\nIn 2016, Grant launched Community Clothing making affordable ethical clothing and supporting UK textile jobs.

{"designer_name": "Calvin Klein", "URL": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/people/calvin-klein/", "birthdate": 1942, "summary": "With his minimalist aesthetic and sensual imagery, he launched an iconic American lifestyle brand encompassing apparel, fragrance and jewellery.", "biography": "In 1968, Calvin Klein founded Calvin Klein Limited, a coat shop in the York Hotel in New York, with $10,000. The first Calvin Klein collection was a line of \"youthful, understated coats and dresses\" featured at the New York store, Bonwit Teller. Just one year later, in September 1969, Klein’s designs appeared on the cover of American Vogue.\n\nBy 1971, Klein had added sportswear, classic blazers and lingerie to his women's collection. By 1977, annual revenues had increased to $30 million, and Klein had licenses for scarves, shoes, belts, furs, sunglasses and sheets. In 1978, Klein claimed sales of 200,000 pairs of his famous jeans the first week they were on the market. By 1981, Fortune figured Klein's annual income at $8.5 million a year. In the mid-1970s, he had created a designer-jeans craze by putting his name on the back pocket.\n\nIn the 1980s, as the designer-jeans frenzy reached its all-time high, Calvin Klein introduced a highly successful line of boxer shorts for women and a men's underwear collection which would later gross $70 million in a single year. In the early 1980s, Klein changed the American market of men's underwear — one where most men's underwear was white, purchased in packs of three by a \"wife, mother or girlfriend when they needed to be\" to one where \"the American male cared about the brand of something few ever see.\"\n\nThe stunning growth continued through the early '80s. The licensing program, which brought in $24,000 when it was initiated in 1974, had royalty income of $7.3 million ten years later. In 1984, worldwide retail sales were estimated at more than $600 million, Klein's clothes were sold through 12,000 stores in the United States and were available in six other countries. His annual income passed $12 million.\n\nAlthough the company almost faced bankruptcy in 1992, Calvin Klein managed to regain and increase the profitability of his empire throughout the later 1990s, mainly through the success of its highly popular underwear and fragrance lines, as well as the CK sportswear line. During his 1990-to-1995 stint as Calvin Klein's head of menswear design, John Varvatos pioneered a type of men's underwear called boxer briefs, a hybrid of boxer shorts and briefs. Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark \"Marky Mark\" Wahlberg, the boxer briefs were called \"one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century.\" Klein was named \"America's Best Designer\" for his minimalist all-American designs in 1993.\n\nCalvin Klein's advertising campaigns were frequently controversial, but this proved to be very successful. In the early 1990s, Calvin Klein was also responsible for launching the international career of supermodel  Kate Moss  and offering her another opportunity to revive her career in 2002 after cocaine allegations.\n\nIn mid-December 2002, Calvin Klein Inc was sold to Phillips Van Heusen Corp (PVH), whose then chief executive Bruce Klatsky was the driving force behind the deal, for about $400 million in cash and $30 million in stock, as well as licensing rights and royalties linked to revenues over the following 15 years that were estimated at $200 to $300 million. The sale also included an on-going personal financial incentive for Klein based on future sales of the Calvin Klein brand.\n\nInitially, Klein remained creative head of the collections as part of the 15-year contract with PVH, but then continued as an advisor (consulting creative director) to the new company from 2003, and has since been more withdrawn from the business.\n\nCalvin Klein is also world famous for various lines of perfumes and colognes, including Obsession and Eternity.

The move surprised many fashion insiders, given that British designers Luella Bartley and  Katie Hillier  had been brought in to revamp the contemporary label only two years earlier. But, by June 2018, the Marc Jacobs brand had been losing more than €50 million annually for the last few years, with flat revenues over that time period, estimated Luca Solca, then head of luxury goods research at Exane BNP Paribas.\n\nIn 1981, following his graduation from the High School of Art and Design, Jacobs enrolled in Parsons the New School for Design, undertaking a degree in womenswear design. Jacobs’s senior year project consisted of three oversized sweaters hand-knit by his grandmother. He was awarded the young designer the school’s Chester Weinberg and Perry Ellis Gold Thimble award, as well as Design Student of the Year.\n\nIn 1986, Jacobs and former Reuben Thomas executive Robert Duffy launched their first design venture under the Marc Jacobs label, earning Jacobs the industry’s interest and a CFDA/Perry Ellis award for New Fashion Talent. In 1989, Jacobs joined Perry Ellis to oversee its womenswear, but was famously fired by management in 1993, following an unsuccessful grunge collection. Jacobs and Duffy launched the Marc Jacobs International company shortly after, creating a few independent collections, before selling 96 percent of the shareholding to LVMH in 1997. The sale coincided with Jacobs' appointment as Louis Vuitton's artistic director.\n\nCritical to Jacobs’ creative strategy at Vuitton were the designer’s hugely successful collaborations with contemporary artists, including Stephen Sprouse (2001), Takashi Murakami (2005), Richard Prince (2007) and Yayoi Kusama (2012).

In addition to his main line, Owens has a furniture line and a number of diffusion lines: Drkshdw, Rickowenslilies and Hunrickowens.\n\nHaving dropped out of Otis College of Art and Design, Owens took a course in pattern cutting at Los Angeles’s Trade Technical College. A scarcity of work led to Owens accepting a position cutting patterns for illegal copies of designer clothing. In 1994, he began his own label, selling exclusively to Charles Gallay, one of LA’s hippest and most directional retailers. In 2001, the designer sought international expansion and agreed a distribution deal with Eo Bocci Associati. As a consequence, the designer’s production relocated to Italy.\n\nOwens broke into the highest echelons of the industry after French Vogue ran an image of Kate Moss wearing one of his leather jackets. Owens was able to utilise the momentum with assistance from Anna Wintour and American Vogue, and the publication sponsored his first show at New York Fashion Week’s Spring/Summer 2002 season. He also began his longstanding collaboration with stylist Panos Yiapanis in 2001 who, to date, has worked on every single one of Owens’ presentations.\n\nIn 2002, Owens was appointed artistic director at Revillon, the French fur company that was founded in 1723. Working and producing in Europe led him to move from Los Angeles to Paris and show during the Paris collections.

In 1999 Aeffe bought Moschino, and in 2012, also secured the licence for Emanuel Ungaro. In a design capacity, Ferretti boasts a dedicated international following for her ultra-feminine and ethereal cocktail dresses and gowns and is regularly championed by influential, high-profile personalities in fashion editorials.\n\nFerretti began her career in fashion in 1968, by opening a fashion boutique named Jolly in Cattolica, Italy. She launched her namesake label in 1974 and, having garnered a cult following through her boutique, expanded her reach to Milan in the early eighties, founding her first showroom and debuting at Milan Fashion Week. In 1984 the designer launched Ferretti Jeans Philosophy — renamed Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti in 1987 — as her first diffusion label aimed towards the youth market. The designer has since diversified into bridal through Alberta Ferretti Forever, childrenswear through Alberta Ferretti Girls and sportswear through Alberta Ferretti Tech. In 2009, the designer also introduced her first namesake fragrance.\n\nThroughout her longstanding career, Ferretti has played a significant role in promoting Italian culture and business and has been awarded several accolades in recognition of her work, such as the Cavalieri del Lavoro by the Italian president in 1998 and a Lifetime Achievement Award in Rome in 2005. Following her work in refurbishing the four-star Palazzo Viviani hotel and a turn as the first female board member of the Italian bank Foundation of the Cassa di Risparmio di Rimini, Ferretti was also named as best female entrepreneur by Italian representatives in 1991.\n\nIn October of 2018, Ferretti received the American Award.

An immediate hit, Kors’ collection was bought by Bloomingdales, Bergdorf Goodman, Lord & Taylor, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue.\n\nIn 1997, Kors was named the first-ever women's ready-to-wear designer and creative director of Céline, where he helped to turn the French fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line, before leaving in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand.\n\nKors launched his menswear line in 2002.

He debuted his first designs for the house during Paris Couture Week in January 2015.\n\n“Margiela is ready for a new charismatic creative soul,” said Renzo Rosso , president of OTB, in a statement. “John Galliano is one of the greatest, undisputed talents of all time. A unique, exceptional couturier for a Maison that always challenged and innovated the world of fashion. I look forward to his return to create that fashion dream that only he can create, and wish him to here find his new home.”\n\nGalliano fell from the highest echelons of the fashion establishment, as creative director of Dior in 2011, following his conviction for making anti-Semitic remarks while inebriated.\n\nAfter attending St Anthony's School and Wilson's Grammar School in London, Galliano studied at Central Saint Martins, from which he graduated in 1988. His first collection, inspired by the French Revolution and entitled Les Incroyables, was bought in its entirety for sale in the London’s Browns boutique. Galliano quickly started his own fashion label and began work with long-term collaborator Amanda Harlech, at the time a fashion editor for Harper’s and Queen.\n\nFollowing a number of false starts with regards to agreements with financial backers, Galliano relocated to Paris to put on his first show as part of Paris Fashion Week in 1989. By 1990, he was bankrupt, and with London offering little by way of relief, the designer permanently relocated to Paris.\n\nGalliano’s inability to find a secure and permanent financial backer finally came to an end with the help of American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and André Leon Talley, then European Correspondent at Vanity Fair. Unable to pay to put on his Spring/Summer 1993 show, Talley asked socialite São Schlumberger to lend her 18th-century hôtel particulier for the show. Wintour and Talley arranged financing with the Paine Webber banking group. The collection that followed, dubbed Princess Lucretia, received rave reviews. The New Yorker reported Diane von Furstenberg called it “a watershed moment in modern fashion history.”\n\nBernard Arnault appointed Galliano as the head designer of Givenchy in 1995; the appointment made Galliano the first British designer to head a French haute couture house. In October 1996, LVMH moved Galliano to Dior. In 1997 the CFDA named him international designer of the year. He was named British Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 1987, 1994, 1995, 1997. The bias cut, the Nefertiti couture collection, the saddlebag — under Galliano, Dior would dominate fashion reporting thanks to the spectacle of his shows and the commerciality of his creations.\n\nFollowing the publication of recordings of Galliano making anti-Semitic remarks, made in June and December 2010, Galliano was sentenced to pay a total of €6,000 ($8,400) in suspended fines in September 2011 after a French court found him guilty of giving public insults on account of race. Galliano retired from the public in order to deal with addiction problems.\n\nIn early 2013, following his rehabilitation for alcohol and substance abuse, Galliano accepted an invitation from Oscar de la Renta for a temporary residency at de la Renta's design studio for the Autumn/Winter 2013 season. Galliano ended his first television interview since his conviction saying, \"I am able to create.

At Burberry, he lifted sales after faltering period, and revamping the company's brand identity. \n\nTisci grew up in a tight-knit, single-parent, working-class family in Italy. The designer describes his family life as hugely influential on him and remembers his childhood as one filled with love. Tisci left regular school aged 11 to enroll in art school in Milan. “I wanted to express myself and I couldn't really do it through words at that point,\" he told The Daily Telegraph. The designer was selected for a scholarship by Central Saint Martins, from which he graduated in 1999. He then held design positions at Puma, Antonio Berardi and with Ruffo Research, before embarking on his own brand in 2004. As a result of his bold, powerfully-feminine designs, Tisci was announced as the creative director of Givenchy’s womenswear and haute couture lines in 2005. After announcing his amicable departure from the house in February 2017 with a subsequent sabbatical, Tisci was named chief creative officer at Burberry in March 2018, succeeding Christopher Bailey .\n\nTisci’s creations found willing consumers immediately; the designer’s vision for Givenchy initially found traction with consumers rather than editors.

He chose to stop showing couture in 2012, taking the business behind the scenes in-house once more.\n\nIn May 2008 he was appointed chief designer of menswear and menswear accessories in addition to his womenswear role. His menswear collections have received rampant critical acclaim and caused the formation of tribe-like followers, many of whom, such as Kanye West, are very much in the public eye. Tisci’s marriage of streetwear influences, Parisian sensibilities and global motifs made Givenchy’s printed sweatshirts a fashion staple, as well as broadening the brand’s appeal exponentially.\n\nFollowing over a decade of experience at the creative helm of Givenchy, Tisci transitioned to Burberry, an announcement that sent share prices soaring by over 5 percent. Joining Marco Gobetti a second time, who also joined Burberry as its chief executive following a stint at Givenchy, Tisci took on plans to reinvigorate product and consumer experiences and expand Burberry's first venture into high end streetwear after a partnership with Gosha Rubchinsky in 2018. Under Tisci's watch, both Burberry's London flagship location and it's monogram logo underwent a revamp, the latter of which debuted with a series of international pop-up installations featuring the new Peter Saville -designed Burberry logo. Following the highly anticipated first Spring/Summer 2019 collection and logo redesign, Burberry reported a 4 percent rise in first quarter comparable store sales in 2019.

It was a productive period with a lasting legacy; Gaultier later told Colin McDowell , “With Cardin, I always felt that anything was possible. He was very much the showman. He used to say, ‘I want to see a collection for women who go to the moon.’ Always, there was an idea.”\n\nAfter a brief time at Jacques Esterel, he was hired at Jean Patou. “When I started my career, I went to work with Pierre Cardin. At that time, of course, I didn’t have my line or whatever, so I didn’t have my style at all. I was doing Cardin. So I was sketching, imagining what he would love, and afterwards, when I was at Patou, Michel Goma was the designer, so I was in the spirit of Michel Goma. I quite loved that.”\n\nIn 1976 Gaultier presented his first solo collection, using unorthodox, inexpensive materials like braided straw. Gaultier quickly gained attention due to his unconventional designs, which included sailor suits, male skirts and razor sharp and exaggerated tailoring.\n\nGaultier launched his highly regarded haute couture line in 1997. In couture, the designer was able to freely express the scope and range of his aesthetic, drawing inspiration from radically divergent cultures — from imperial India to Hasidic Judaism — to critical acclaim.

In 2009 he was appointed as the company's chief creative officer, and, in 2014, this was expanded to a dual position to include chief executive, a title he held until July 2017. In the newly created role as president, Bailey will work in partnership with Gobbetti to oversee all elements of brand and design.\n\nSince joining the company, Bailey has helped recast Burberry as a digital pioneer, spearheading innovative digital campaigns including the “Art of the Trench” with street style photographer Scott Schuman , and being one of the initial big luxury brands to utilise Snapchat (Bailey premiered the entire Burberry Spring/Summer 2016 collection on the platform a day before the catwalk show). Under Bailey, the brand pioneered a tech-infused “retail entertainment” environment and omni-channel strategy that has seen it universally recognised for its next-generation customer experience.\n\nAdvertising has played an integral role in Bailey’s repositioning of the company. Celebrated photographer Mario Testino lenses Burberry’s campaigns, which have starred models including Lily Donaldson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and  Cara Delevingne , as well as globally-renowned British actors like Emma Watson , Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones and Sienna Miller. Under Bailey's leadership, the heritage brand was also a pioneer of \"see now, buy now,\" unveiling its first collection using the new fashion-immediacy model in September 2016 at London Fashion Week. The consumer-facing concept also saw the launch of Maker's House, the label's Soho-based show space, that also acts as a brand-focused exhibition pop up open to the public for a limited time after each show.\n\nIn 2008, Bailey and Ahrendts launched the Burberry Foundation and Burberry Acoustic, which aim to support emerging talent. The brand regularly collaborates with musicians and its shows have become well-known for their accompanying musical spectacles. He has won the British Fashion Awards's Menswear Designer of the Year accolade three times (in 2007, 2008 and 2013) and was crowned Designer of the Year, in 2009 — the same year he was honoured with an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List. In 2014 and 2017 Bailey was announced Designer of the Year in GQ's Men of the Year Awards, and the following year he was honoured at the Elle Style Awards with the Editor's Choice title. His final collection for Burberry, which debuted on the Saturday of London Fashion Week in October 2018, was dedicated to LGBT youth.", "location": "United Kingdom", "careers": [{"jobTitle": "Chief Creative Officer & Chief Executive Officer", "timePeriod": "2001 - 2018", "employer": "Burberry"}, {"jobTitle": null, "timePeriod": "1996 - 2001", "employer": "Gucci"}, {"jobTitle": null, "timePeriod": "1994 - 1996", "employer": "Donna Karan"}], "education": [{"timePeriod": null, "description": null, "profile": {"profileId": "2004", "title": "University of Westminster", "slug": "university-of-westminster", "isLinkable": true, "profileThumbnail": {"imageUrl": "https://prod-bof-media.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/import/filestack/avatar/university-of-westminster.png", "arcAuthKey": "acde5338b2c21807db18a21eb3600cb57b4ef36f8617f79da2c13261d09e899f", "backgroundColor": "#ffffff", "__typename": "ProfileThumbnail"}, "__typename": "OrganisationProfile"}, "__typename": "Education"}, {"timePeriod": null, "description": null, "profile": {"profileId": "1608", "title": "Royal College of Art", "slug": "royal-college-of-art", "isLinkable": true, "profileThumbnail": {"imageUrl": "https://prod-bof-media.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/import/filestack/avatar/profile_avatar.jpeg", "arcAuthKey": "b71bf774a6e9d81ea1c35480e6c3b32bd434dfcf81907bfdcd7b21687b425869", "backgroundColor": "#cdcdcd", "__typename": "ProfileThumbnail"}, "__typename": "OrganisationProfile"}, "__typename": "Education"}], "socialLinks": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bailey_(fashion_Designers)", "http://www.burberry.com/", "https://twitter.com/Burberry", "http://instagram.com/burberry", "https://www.facebook.com/burberry", "http://burberry.tumblr.com/", "http://pinterest.com/burberry/", "http://www.youtube.com/burberry", "http://www.linkedin.com/company/burberry"]}

He took up the mantle of creative director in 2001 and re-established a strong, commercially successful DNA for the French brand over his 14-year tenure. In October 2015, unexpected news emerged that he was exiting from his long-held role, \"the decision of the company's majority shareholder.\" The break between Elbaz and the brand was said to have followed disagreements between the designer and Lanvin’s owner Shaw-Lan Wang and chief executive Michèle Huiban.\n\nElbaz, who was born in Morocco, began his career working at a small dressmaker’s shop in the Garment District of New York. Having moved to Israel in his youth, the designer studied at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design, before moving to New York in 1984. Through a connection forged with Gucci’s Dawn Mello, Elbaz was introduced to couturier Geoffrey Beene in 1989.

Prior to joining Lanvin in 2001, Elbaz took a brief sabbatical and served as head designer for Italian design house Krizia.\n\nAt Lanvin, Elbaz entered into a number of collaborations with other companies, including a limited edition cosmetics range with Lancôme and a capsule collection for Swedish high street retailer H&M in 2010.

She never trained to be a fashion designer; instead she studied art and literature at Keio University. Perhaps as a result of this, Kawakubo has always followed the beat of her own drum, both commercially and creatively, and as a result is exulted by the industry as an icon of modernity who continues to make ripples across the fashion industry. She is also co-founder of cult retail destination Dover Street Market , which she and her husband Adrian Joffe established in 2004.\n\nThe Japanese designer entered the industry when she took a job at a textiles factory; in 1967 the designer became freelance stylist. Two years later, she began making clothes under the label Comme Des Garçons. The designer incorporated the label in 1973, a direct result of its popularity with Japanese consumers. For the remainder of the decade, Kawakubo would refine her aesthetic and build her company, opening a Tokyo boutique in 1975 and adding a menswear line, Homme Comme des Garçons, in 1978.\n\nBy the time of her Paris debut in 1981, Kawakubo was so famous that her followers and fans were dubbed “the crows” in the Japanese press. The designer told The New Yorker in 2005 that she “never intended to start a revolution” — she intended only to show “what I thought was strong and beautiful. It just so happened that my notion was different from everybody else’s.”\n\nShe continued to innovate and in doing so inspired numerous designers — Martin Margiela, Ann Demeulemeester and Helmut Lang have all name checked Kawakubo as an inspiration — making fashion a richer palette than before. While many of fashion’s biggest and most visible companies serve as de facto training grounds for rising talent, none have given birth to a collection of creative offspring quite like Commes des Garçons. Kawakubo launched the careers of Junya Watanabe and Tao Kurihara, and in 2013 added Kei Ninomiya ’s Noir line to the Comme des Garçons umbrella. Today, the Comme ecosystem now boasts over 20 distinct lines.\n\nKawakubo told Interview, “In good times and bad times the company is more or less the same. Comme des Garçons has always travelled at its own pace and will continue to do so.” It has, and fashion is the better for it.\n\nIn May 2019, Kawakubo received the Isamu Noguchi Award, making her the first fashion designer to receive the prize, which was created in 2014 to recognise innovative artists following in Noguchi’s footsteps by bridging Eastern and Western cultures.", "location": "Japan", "careers": [{"jobTitle": "Founder", "timePeriod": "1973 - Present", "employer": "Comme des Garçons"}, {"jobTitle": null, "timePeriod": null, "employer": "Dover Street Market"}], "education": [{"timePeriod": null, "description": null, "profile": {"profileId": "1485736414295494", "title": "Keio University", "slug": "keio-university", "isLinkable": false, "profileThumbnail": null, "__typename": "OrganisationProfile"}, "__typename": "Education"}], "socialLinks": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rei_Kawakubo", "http://www.comme-des-garcons.com/", "https://twitter.com/COMMEGARCONS", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Comme-des-Gar%C3%A7ons/182051148498313", "http://comme-des-garcon.tumblr.com/"]}

Known for his engagement with social media, the designer has mastered the art of catering to the digital generation. \n\nThe French designer’s steep career trajectory was paved with opportunity.

Graduating in 2003, he began his career as a designer at Roberto Cavalli , quickly climbing the ranks to become head of the brand’s womenswear division. Rousteing was hired by Balmain in 2009 as a women’s ready-to-wear designer, and worked very closely with the house’s then creative director, Christophe Decarnin, who became something of a mentor to him. When Decarnin stepped down from the helm in April 2011, Rousteing was appointed his successor.\n\nAlain Hivelin, Balmain’s then chairman and majority owner, who passed away at the end of 2014, was responsible for the rapid rise of Decarnin’s relatively-unknown protégé. Today, Rousteing is at the forefront of the brand which has become a recognised hallmark for red carpet couture. Leading its digital revitalisation, Roustieng works under CEO Massimo Pimbini who was appointed in 2017, following the majority stake acquisition of Mayhoola for Investments a year earlier. \n\nBorn into an internet-savvy generation, Rousteing was one of the pioneers of Instagram marketing, with his “Balmain Army” of influencers dressed in the brand’s signature military style. It comprises a force of strong, internationally famous women and trending virtual influencers including Kendall Jenner , Gigi Hadid , Kim Kardashian West and computer-generated models Margot, Shudu and Zhi, who have each amassed a sizeable following on the platform. Rousteing’s knack for digital inspired a Balmain-themed Snapchat selfie-filter and the Balmain app in 2019 with its accompanying its digital flagship store, opened in partnership with Yoox, Net-a-porter group and the Mazarine luxury e-commerce platform. Balmain is also one of the first brands to sign onto Instagram’s new shopping feature in 2019.\n\nThe French designer is also a strong advocate for diversity within the fashion industry, a mantra that chimes well with his international customer base. Rousteing is himself an inspiration to a number of aspiring designers, who, until recently, lacked a successful mixed-race role model. He also expressed his dedication to the cause in his Spring/Summer 2019 campaign, featuring Cara Delevigne in an homage to Janet Jackson’s album artwork for Janet, conceptualising the union between white and black skin. \n\nIn May 2017 Balmain and L'Oréal Paris collaborated on a collection of lipsticks that he had designed himself. He cited the partnership as an opportunity to make Balmain accessible to a wider audience. For the 2018 edition of Coachella, Beyoncé entrusted Roustieng to create three couture pieces for her performance.

In June 2016, Wang added the roles of chief executive and chairman to his official list of responsibilities, replacing his sister-in-law Aimie Wang as chief executive, and his mother Ying Wang as chairwoman. However, in October 2017, Wang relinquished his chief executive title, appointing former Goop and Martha Stewart Omnimedia head Lisa Gersh to the position. In addition to heading up his namesake brand, he also held the post of creative director at Balenciaga from 2012 to 2015.\n\nWang’s foray into fashion began at age 15, when he attended a summer design programme at Central Saint Martins, choosing to move to New York City to attend Parsons School of Design at age 18. Two years later, he dropped out of the Parsons School of Design in 2004 to start his own label, initially creating a knitwear collection based on six unisex silhouettes. Wang was initially supported in his venture by his family: his brother assumed the role of chief financial advisor, his sister-in-law acted as chief principal officer, and the designer was able to utilise family connections to source production from China. His label soon evolved into a sleek but fully realised women’s ready-to-wear collection; Wang debuted his first runway collection for Autumn/Winter 2007 at New York Fashion Week. Years later, Alexander Wang is stocked in over 700 stores in 7 countries and carried by the likes of Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Dover Street Market . \n\nAnna Wintour , a key supporter, mobilised her influence to bring attention to the young designer. In 2008, Wang received the top award from the Vogue/CFDA Fashion Fund, a sum of $200,000. In 2009, he was announced as the winner of the Swarovski Womenswear Designer of the Year, and as the winner of the Swiss Textiles Award.\n\nIn December 2012 Wang was appointed creative director of Balenciaga, succeeding Nicolas Ghesquière at the storied French house. Wang’s debut collection for the brand was positively received, despite having faced scepticism about his ability to fill Nicolas Ghesquière's shoes. In July 2015, however, it was announced that Balenciaga and Kering decided not to renew the American designer's contract.\n\nAlexander Wang now produces both menswear and womenswear main line collections, a diffusion line — T by Alexander Wang — for men and women, footwear, and accessories. In 2011, Wang’s entry into menswear was noted by GQ, who named him Best Menswear Designer. In the same year, he won the CFDA Award for Best Accessory Designer. Wang’s aesthetic remains true throughout his various lines, and has inspired an entire generation of women to dress in his sportswear-inspired looks. In 2014, Wang entered into a partnership with H&M, creating a women's and menswear collection for the Swedish retailer.\n\nWhen Wang succeeded his mother as CEO in 2016, he also won a $90 million lawsuit against 459 websites selling counterfeit Wang products. In 2017, HypeBeast added Wang to its list of the top 100 influencers in the fashion industry.

The long-awaited venture, which finally launched in October 2023, spans clothing and accessories, fusing the luxe minimalism Philo is best known for with a raw, shredded edge, BoF editor-at-large Tim Blanks observed. \n\nBefore starting her own brand, Philo spent 10 years as creative director at LVMH-owned Celine, which she transformed from a sleepy bourgeois label into a much-copied global fashion force that generated $900 million in annual sales, according to analyst estimates, before her 2017 exit. Her work at the house, known for its unfussy minimalist aesthetic, attracted a loyal fanbase of “Philophiles” and redefined what many women aspired to wear.\n\nPhilo studied at Central Saint Martins before joining her friend Stella McCartney at Chloé as her first assistant in 1997. Following McCartney’s exit from Chloé in 2001, Philo took over the reins of the house as creative director, turning the house into one of Paris Fashion Week’s most coveted invites and a commercial success thanks to her effortless, feminine creations and profitable “It” bag designs, such as the Paddington, which launched in 2005.\n\nPhilo resigned from Chloé in 2006, taking a step back from the fast-paced fashion industry, but after a two-year hiatus, returned to the industry to take the job at Celine. With regards to her aesthetic, Philo told British Vogue, “I felt it was time for a more back-to-reality approach to fashion, clothes that are beautiful, strong and have ideas, but with real life driving them.” Her sentiments reflected the mood of the moment and resulted in  a new roster of cult items, including the much-copied luggage tote, driving double-digit growth for the label.\n\nIn December 2017, it was announced Philo would leave Celine after its Autumn/Winter 2018 presentation, taking a hiatus before confirming her return to fashion in July 2021 as the majority owner of her own clothing and accessories label, backed by her former employer LVMH. After multiple delays, the designer’s direct-to-consumer brand launched in October 2023 to much fanfare, though the venture remains small compared to the labels she previously helmed. \n\n“Being in my studio and making once again has been both exciting and incredibly fulfilling,” she told BoF at the time. “I am very much looking forward to being back in touch with my audience and people everywhere. To be independent, to govern and experiment on my own terms is hugely significant to me.”\n\nPhilo won British Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 2010, for the second time.

The designer joined the French luxury house in February 2018, as its artistic, creative and image director, making his debut expanding the label’s offering into menswear, couture and fragrance collections, debute dat the Spring/Summer 19 Paris fashion week.\n\nThe Frenchman began his career in the 1990s as an assistant in fashion marketing at Yves Saint Laurent . In 1996 Pierre Bergé installed Slimane in the position of ready-to-wear director of men's collections at Yves Saint Laurent. (Slimane would later become artistic director of the line.) After the ‘Black Tie’ collection for Autumn/Winter 2000, which foreshadowed the advent of Slimane's skinny silhouette, Slimane chose to leave Yves Saint Laurent and declined an offer to take up the creative directorship at Jil Sander as well.\n\nImmediately after leaving Yves Saint Laurent, Slimane moved to Berlin, where he took up a residency at the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art between 2000 and 2002. Slimane also released his first photography book, “Berlin” — a selection of black and white photographs — published by Karl Lagerfeld ’s publishing arm, Édition 7L, which is a division of the German house Steidl.\n\nIn 2000 he took up the position of creative director for Dior Homme, during which he received immediate success and popularised the skinny silhouette in menswear. In April 2002, Slimane was the first menswear designer to receive the CFDA International Designer award. David Bowie, whom Slimane dressed for his tours, presented the designer with the award.\n\nSlimane left Dior in 2007 to focus on photographic projects but returned to Yves Saint Laurent in 2012 as creative director, overseeing the brand’s womenswear and menswear collections. By his request, the ready-to-wear lines were rebranded as Saint Laurent and the design studio was partially relocated to LA, a scene that has permeated Slimane’s designs for the house.\n\nDuring his four years at Saint Laurent, Slimane divided opinion, but his youth culture-driven collections, which are closely tied to the music scene, proved to be commercially successful. According to Sanford C. Bernstein, from 2012 to 2014, Saint Laurent revenues grew more than 20 percent each year, outperforming the overall market for luxury goods despite having a significantly smaller retail network — 142 stores — than larger houses like Louis Vuitton or Gucci. In April 2016, Kering announced in a statement that Slimane would not be renewing his contract with Saint Laurent.\n\nSlimane roused mixed reactions for his personal incarnation of Celine – some deifying the designer and praising his return, while others heavily reprimanded the Laurent-ification of Celine, with as Slimane imposed his signature slender style onto the French brand. Under Slimane’s watch, Céline has undergone a number of rebranding efforts: it dropped its accent aigu and “Paris” under the name inspired by its original 1960s design, and the flagship store in Miami was revamped, among other store fleet. The luxury brand also announced in late 2018, that its menswear division would soon produce standalone stores for the Spring/Summer 2019 season.

Gabbana became a mentor of sorts to Dolce, and when Gabbana returned from his mandatory military tour, the two launched a design consultancy together and eventually started “Dolce and Gabbana”, with a runway debut in 1985 at Milan Fashion Week.\n\nSlowly, the pair launched other product lines, including knitwear and accessories, and gained notoriety particularly for their sensual dresses and menswear, which won them the 1991 Woolmark Prize. In the early 1990s, pop star Madonna selected them as her costume designers for her “Girlie” world tour and wore one of their jewel-encrusted corsets to the Cannes Film Festival. Throughout the ‘90s, the duo were famed for their overtly feminine, colourful garments, which stood in stark contrast to the wave of minimalism that was sweeping across fashion at the time. For several seasons’ campaigns and runway shows, the pair have cast ordinary men and women, typically from their native Italy. They have designed for everyone from AC Milan to Motorola and have also co-authored a dozen or so books detailing their collections and legacy.\n\nIn June 2013, Dolce and Gabbana were charged and convicted of tax evasion, however the duo successfully appealed to overturn their conviction and were pronounced innocent by the Italian Supreme Court of Justice in October 2014. “We have always been honest, and we are extremely proud of this recognition by the Italian Court of Justice. Viva l’Italia,” said the pair in a statement at the time. In late 2018, the duo came under media fire for when the brand posted a marketing campaign featuring an Italian model eating Italian food with chopsticks, that was deemed derogatory to Chinese culture. Following the outrage, Gabbana was ousted online for a racist feud between him and another Instagram user. With Chinese consumers making up a sizeable chunk of the luxury market, the brand lost a large part of its Asian-Pacific market due to boycotts. By November, the brand cancelled its Shanghai fashion show.  the first quarter of 2019, social media engagement for the brand fell by 98 percent compared to the same time last year.  In 2019, the brand also announced it would extend its style sizes to 14-18, as of its pre-fall 2019 collection.

For a period of time, even the colours red, white and blue were synonymous with the designer. The designer pioneered courting hip-hop artists, in a time before it was common practice, extending his brand’s reach even further. Hilfiger sold his company the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation, the umbrella for 14 product lines, for $1.6 billion in 2006. In March 2010, Phillips-Van Heusen, owner of Calvin Klein , bought the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation for $3 billion.\n\nHilfiger grew up in Elmira, New York, and started to work in retail at the age of 18. Hilfiger’s entrepreneurial spirit arose young. The designer told Forbes, “During my senior year in high school, I started a business with some school buddies. We chipped in $125 apiece and started selling jeans. Then we opened a store called the People’s Place. It was a smash hit,\" he said. \"It got to the point where I was selling jeans out of the trunk of my car because people wanted them so badly. Much to my parents’ dismay, I decided to skip college. I really believed that I could teach myself how to grow a business and a brand and get my degree in the 'real world.'\"\n\nAfter seven years The People's Place went bankrupt, Hilfiger was 25. The designer responded by studying commerce, “I forced myself to learn the nuts and bolts of the business, and not solely on the creative side. I got hyper-focused on it. I learned how to read a balance sheet. I figured out how to control expenses and figured out a way to build a business on a shoestring budget. In school they teach you through case studies of other companies. I had my own case study.”\n\n“When I was 28, I formed a design team and landed Jordache as a client. They liked our designs but then decided that they didn’t need to expand beyond jeans, so they let us go. I was back on the pavement. A year later, in 1985, I decided it was time to create my own brand.” Although he was offered design assistant positions with Calvin Klein and Perry Ellis, he turned down the offers despite the fact that he was broke.\n\nBy 1988 his brand had sales of $25 million. “We reached $500 million in the mid-1990s. By the end of that decade our sales were $1 billion. Our success, I think, was a mixture of luck, hard work and following through with our plan.” Hilfiger became an industry pioneer by sponsoring the tours of Britney Spears, The Rolling Stones, Sheryl Crowe, Jewel and Lenny Kravitz; the Tommy Hilfiger brand also collaborated on fragrance campaigns with Beyoncé and Enrique Iglesias, and a fashion campaign with icon David Bowie and supermodel Iman.\n\nBy 2004, the company had 5,400 employees and revenues in excess of $1.8 billion. The Council of Fashion Designers of America named Hilfiger Menswear Designer of the Year in 1995; he was again honoured by the CFDA in 2012, which presented him with the prestigious Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award. Today, its product portfolio includes Hilfiger Collection for women, Tommy Hilfiger Tailored for men, Hilfiger Denim, men’s and women’s sportswear, and kidswear. Through select licensees, the brand also offers lifestyle products such as footwear, eyewear, sunglasses, watches, jewellery, handbags, socks, fragrances and bedding.\n\nIn 2010, the Tommy Hilfiger business was acquired by PVH Corp. Hilfiger remains the company’s principal designer, providing leadership and direction. Today, the brand has an extensive distribution network spanning over 100 countries and operates more than 1,600 Tommy Hilfiger retail stores throughout five continents, as well as on tommy.com.\n\nHilfiger’s experiences at the beginning of his career also impacted his commitment to mentoring the next generation of aspiring designers. Tommy Hilfiger sponsored five seasons of “Americans in Paris” — a CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund initiative to support emerging American designers — and as a direct result of the program Hilfiger collaborated with designers Simon Spurr, Peter Som, Albertus Swanepoel and George Esquivel.\n\nHilfiger's desire to give back extends beyond the industry. Back in 1995, Hilfiger launched The Tommy Hilfiger Corporate Foundation with the mission to empower America’s youth, placing a major emphasis on education and cultural programs. In 2012, all foundation activities were aligned under the global banner TommyCares, to unite the brand’s philanthropic commitments, non-profit partnerships and employee engagement. TommyCares works with PVH global partners Save the Children, the World Wildlife Fund and War Child, among others.\n\nHilfiger is married to Dee Ocleppo Hilfiger, and together they have five children.

His ability to do so stemmed from his prodigious talent and fashion’s seemingly insatiable appetite for his designs. His skill at cutting and his idiosyncratic takes on classic silhouettes have made Alaïa popular for decades. In November 2017, at the age of 82, Alaïa died in Paris. \n\nAlaïa signed a partnership with the Prada Group in 2000, a second renaissance for the designer. He then bought his brand back from the group in 2007 to enter an agreement with Richemont. Having remained relatively unchanged following the deal, the Alaïa brand underwent a Richemont-backed expansion.\n\nTunisian Alaïa’s love of fashion began through his reading of Vogue at a young age. After lying about his age to attend the École des Beaux-Arts in Tunis, where he trained as a sculptor, he began working as a dressmaker and the moved to Paris in 1957. There he started his career at Christian Dior as a tailleur, but soon moved to work for Guy Laroche for two seasons followed by Thierry Mugler. Alaïa opened his first atelier in his Rue de Bellechasse apartment in the late 1970s, from which he dressed private clientele including Marie-Hélène de Rothschild, Louise de Vilmorin and Greta Garbo.\n\nIn 1980 he produced his first ready-to-wear collection, which was championed by the then-doyennes of fashion, Melka Tréanton and Nicole Crassat, who both regularly featured his work in Elle and French Elle respectively.\n\nThat same year, Alaïa moved to larger premises in Paris and by 1988 he had opened boutiques in Beverly Hills and New York, and was soon dubbed the ‘King of Cling’ by the media.

After a stint as creative director at Emanuel Ungaro, Dundas was appointed artistic director at Emilio Pucci, owned by LVMH, in 2008, before returning to Cavalli. \n\nDuring his seven-year tenure at Pucci, Dundas developed the brand’s history of glamorous, colourful and patterned collections. Focusing on nightlife as a key inspiration, Dundas took Pucci in a new, youthful direction. It was under the creative helm of Dundas that LVMH identified the label as a key future-growth vehicle, branching into new product categories such as shoes, handbags and eyewear.\n\nIn 2017, Dundas started his own namesake label with co-founder Evangelo Bousis.

Most recently he was the creative director of Theory, having initially launched a capsule collection entitled Theysken’s Theory with the contemporary label, founded by Andrew Rosen and now owned by Fast Retailing.\n\nHe exited the brand in June 2014, showing his final collection for the label — Spring/Summer 2015 — in September.\n\nTheyskens told Out of Order magazine that as a child he loved playing with clothes and fabrics, a passion that drove the decision to attend the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Visuels de la Cambre to study fashion design in 1994. In 1997, the burgeoning designer dropped out to start his own label. His first collections were contemporaneously described as gothic extravaganzas, and were created from bed sheets that his grandmother gave to him. Without sufficient financial support, he was forced to close his label.\n\nTheyskens then began creating stage costumes for the Théâtre de la Monnaie. He was brought to the wider public’s attention when, in 1998, Madonna wore one of his dresses to the Academy Awards.\n\nRochas appointed Theyskens as its creative director in 2002. In March 2003 Theyskens presented his first collection for the house. While there, Theysken’s focus on demi-couture was questioned in business circles as a viable model for the house. In an unexpected announcement Procter & Gamble, Rochas's owner, announced the discontinuation of Rochas's fashion division in July 2006.\n\nIn November that same year, Theyskens became artistic director of Nina Ricci; his first collection debuted in 2007. Just four years later, Theyskens left Nina Ricci, taking the role of creative director of Theory’s new upscale contemporary line Theysken’s Theory in 2011, which he eventually left in 2014.

Thanks to Chait’s devotion to quality and craftsmanship, mixed with his effortless California cool, the brand is now stocked in some of the most exclusive boutiques around the world.\n\nPreviously, Chait helped establish Australian denim brand Ksubi in the United States, but in 2007, while hanging out Venice Beach, he fell in love with a cashmere blanket his friend had lent him. He couldn’t find one anywhere, so he made some of his own. LA’s Maxfield boutique snapped them up to sell the next day and Chait jumped on a plane to Paris without a single sales appointment lined up. A week later, The Elder Statesman had picked up a dozen retail accounts, including prestigious retailers such as Barneys and Colette.\n\nExceptional quality and supreme craftsmanship is at the heart of The Elder Statesman’s USP. The cashmere is globally sourced, coming from countries including Afghanistan, Mongolia and Italy, often for as much as $500 per kilo, before being spun by Chait's own team of expert craftsmen — although some is sent as far away as Central America to be woven. A sweater starts from around $800, while the blankets begin at $2,000. In the 2010s, as brands like The Row and Phoebe Philo ’s Céline took centre stage, Chait was well placed to capitalise on the rise of chic simplicity combined with exclusivity. Sweaters are unbranded, product runs are usually limited to 50 units and Chait creates each collection for his stockists individually – no two boutiques have the same assortment.\n\nThe Elder Statesman has since expanded its offering to knitted and woven accessories of all kinds, optical, children’s items, and a robust selection of home goods.\n\nSince the company’s launch, it has expanded into apparel and accessories for men, women and children and today products are stocked in more than 75 stores worldwide.

Born in the northern Italian city of Voghera, Garavani decided to design clothing for women at the age of nine, from a fascination with the movie \"Zeigfeld Girl.\"\n\nWhen he visited Barcelona as a teen, he again encountered a woman who would mould his entire design philosophy at the opera, wearing a red velvet gown. “She was unique, isolated, fiery — the perfect heroine,” he told Vogue. “I told myself that if I were ever going to become a designer, I would do lots of red.”\n\nAnd so he did. \"Valentino red,\" a striking crimson shade, became one of his design signatures, as well as gowns. After studying at the École Des Beaux-Arts in Paris and apprenticing under noted couturiers Balenciaga, Jean Dèsses and Guy Laroche, he returned to Rome in 1959 to set up his own studio in the fashionable Via Condotti with the help of his father. That next year, he met Giancarlo Giammetti, his future business and personal partner, at the Café de Paris.\n\nGaravani’s debut in 1962 in Florence was so well received that international orders and interest flooded in. He also received very favourable reviews in the press. His client list grew to include influential society ladies, and by the mid-‘60s he was considered the top dressmaker to women like Jackie O, Elizabeth Taylor, Gloria Guinness and Princess Margaret, among many others.

Credited with bringing a freshness to Paris’ fashion scene, his collections are deconstructed, surrealist and often \"NSFW.\" Jacquemus takes archetypal French concepts like the Breton stripe and spins them on their head, working in the space between commercial and conceptual. He cites the Japanese brand Comme des Garçons as one of his referential points. \n\nJacquemus moved to Paris when he was 18 and briefly enrolled at the École Supérieure des Arts et techniques de la Mode. In 2009, a year after the passing of his mother, he launched his label under her maiden name, Jacquemus. He began working at the Comme des Garçons store in 2011 to finance his business, after gaining the support of Rei Kawakubo and Adrian Joffe .\n\nHis collections have a child-like spirit and sense of freedom, often featuring asymmetrical designs, oversized \"stiff\" silhouettes, experimental makeup and shoeless or topless models. The designer has his own studio off the Place des Vosges in Le Marais. In 2017, he was invited by the Maison Méditerranéenne des Métiers de la Mode to stage a catwalk in his native Marseille and his Spring/Summer 2018 collection, entitled \"La Bomba,\" was picked up by some of the world's biggest retailers including Selfridges, Moda Operandi and Net-a-Porter. He has also launched a collection of footwear and handbags, as well as a men's line. \n\nJacquemus has a strong social media presence, helped by playful presentation of his images on Instagram, which he runs himself. In this vein, he published a photography book in tandem with the Spring/Summer 2014 collection — \"La Grande Motte\" — a reference to the Languedoc-Roussilon’s seaside resort and his experiences there as a child.\n\nHis playful approach to pushing the boundaries of French fashion has earned him a finalist spot and a special prize at the LVMH Prize in 2014 and 2015 respectively.", "location": "France", "careers": [{"jobTitle": "Designer", "timePeriod": "2009 - Present", "employer": "Jacquemus"}], "education": null, "socialLinks": ["http://jacquemus.com/", "https://twitter.com/jacquemus", "https://instagram.com/jacquemus/", "https://www.facebook.com/JACQUEMUSPARIS"]}

Known for his couture meets clubwear aesthetic, Lii’s theatrical and avant-garde flair has made the brand a popular choice among musicians and other performers. His designs have been worn by Madonna, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Blackpink , Doja Cat , Charli XCX, FKA Twigs and Grimes among others. Actress Fan Bingbing was an early supporter of the brand and has been seen sitting front row at his shows. The brand counts progressive retailers like H.Lorenzo in the US, Machine-A in the UK and Gr8 in Japan as international stockists. Based between Shanghai and Paris, Lii set up an atelier and office in the latter in 2023 to focus on haute couture. \n\nThe Chinese-born designer won VFiles New York Fashion Week runway competition in 2018 while still a student at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp. However, Lii felt his sensibilities did not fit well with the school and eventually dropped out of the programme. After a hiatus during the pandemic in which he did only select concert costume pieces, he held his first show in Shanghai for the Autumn/Winter 2021 season in which he presented both ready-to-wear and couture collections, exploring the idea of a post-human world.  Since then, his intergalactic, cyberpunk signature style has become a standout on the international fashion calendar. “I hope to create another dimension — an alternate reality where things may function differently from the space we inhabit,” Lii told Vogue in 2021. “No boundaries, no judges, and each person is encouraged to be the way they are.”", "location": "France", "careers": null, "education": null, "socialLinks": ["https://windowsen-official.com", "https://www.instagram.com/windowsen/"]}
