Agnona is one of the most exclusive brands of prestigious textile and clothing items in the world. Thants to its original experience in the manufacture of precious fabrics used regularly for the collections of some of the most important stylists in fashion, this company has been manufacturing its own ready-to-wear women’s, men’s and knitwear collections since the 70s. The Company was founded at the beginning of the 50s on the basis of a business project by Francesco Ilorini Mo, in order to reach the highest segment of the market for women’s clothing fabric; Ermenegildo Zegna believed in the project since the beginning and supported its initial phases. Eccentric and innovative, he discovered the pleasure of respecting the raw materials and shaping them in a style that was simple and natural. He developed a preferential relationship with the most important woolgrowers in the world and always achieved unmistakable quality: superfine wools in Australia, alpaca in Peru, cashmere and camelhair in Tibet and China. Since 1994 Agnona has been one of the three members of the International Vicua Consortium, thanks to which it, and only two other members in the world, have the worldwide exclusive on the production and sale of that invaluable fibre. At the Borgosesia facility in Italy, every stage of the procedure is entrusted to specialist departments where technology and craftsmanship work hand in hand. A production that can count on the direct acquisition of the raw materials, on its conversion into precious fabrics, and on garments with a modern style, close attention to detail, and exceptional finish. Very soon, thanks to the significant creative and technical contribution given by Francesco Ilorini Mo and his Family, the Company made a name for itself on the international market with its valuable fabrics such as cashmere, alpaca, camel-hair, extra-fine wool and, more recently, vicuña. Agnona Spa, as Zegna, is a vertical integrated company going from raw material to the final customer. Today Agnona's windows look on to the international shopping streets of Milan, Florence, Venice and Porto Cervo, and the most important airports - Milan Malpensa and Venice Marco Polo - in Tokyo, Shanghai and Seoul, in the dedicated areas of the most prestigious department stores - Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Harrod's - as well as in the best speciality stores in the world's principal markets. The Company’s turnover for 1997 was 67 billion liras (40 million US$) mainly accounted for in Japan and USA, where Agnona also owns a number of shops. The Company employs worldwide around 270 people. Alberto Ilorini, son of the Company’s founder, will continue to be the Chairman of the Agnona Board of Directors, with responsibilities for products and image. Paolo Zegna - co-managing director, with his cousin Gildo, of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group - stated that ""the purpose of this move is to have Agnona's business remain autonomous from Zegna, in order to pay full respect to its brand"". The Zegna Group turnover is expected to be, for 1998, 880 billion liras (530 million US$). Between 1993 and 1997 it doubled its sales, of which 80% are currently made up by foreign markets.",['https://www.facebook.com/Agnona.Official'],"['Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2016']",[],1993.0,Francesco Ilorini Mo

Aquascutum was established in 1851, the year of the Great Exhibition, when tailor and entrepreneur John Emary opened a high quality menswear shop at 46 Regent Street. In 1853, after succeeding to produce the first waterproof wool, he had his discovery patented and renamed the company ï¿½Aquascutumï¿½, Latin for ï¿½watershieldï¿½, which is a very good name for their raincoats which are used as shields to keep out rain. In 1901, Emary moved to 100 Regent Street in the heart of London, which remains Aquascutumï¿½s flagship store to this day. In 1854 during the Crimean War, British military officers were equipped with Aquascutum raincoats. From 1897 Aquascutum were granted a total of 5 royal warrants from Edward VII onwards. In 1900 Aquascutum opened a womenswear department, offering water-repellent capes and coats, which were extremely popular among the suffragettes. Starting with outerwear and riding habits, the company soon offered a fully developed wardrobe for women who prefer style to fashion. During World War I from 1914 to 1918 the company supplied waterproof trenchcoats to the army. After the war was over, these trenchcoats were introduced for civilian wear. In 1927, the company was acquired by the Abraham family and it has continued in family hands. In 1970 Charles Abraham, the Chairman and Managing Director was knighted for services to Britain. In 1953 Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay conquered Mount Everest wearing Aquascutum garments made of D-711 special fabric. From the 1960's onwards, the company has expanded around the world, all over Europe, Japan, Canada and the USA marketing not only raincoats but also menswear, womenswear and other products. Michael Herz has been the designer for womenswear since 2000 and his team includes Graeme Fidler and Hayley Green the accessories designer since 2001. In 2004, the house was taken over by Japanese management. Things began to look up in 2006, when Renown/Kaleido hired Kim Winser as CEO away from Pringle of Scotland to revitalize the brand ï¿½ la longtime rival and heritage brand Burberry (Burberryï¿½s known for plaid while Aquascutumï¿½s associated with a check). Since Winser joined, the international growth of the brand has boomed, thanks in no small part to the placement of celebrities like Pierce Brosnan and Gisele Bï¿½ndchen in the label's campaigns. Success is also the result of co-designers Graeme Fidler (menswear) and Michael Herz (womenswear), whose fame has escalated since the turnaround. By August 2008, mentions arose in the press about a flagship store in New York to add to the companyï¿½s London and Tokyo retail repertoire.

Balenciaga,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/balenciaga/,Paris,France,https://www.balenciaga.com,['Cristï¿½bal Balenciaga'],,"The House of Balenciaga was founded in San Sebastiï¿½n, Spain in 1919 by Cristï¿½bal Balenciaga. With the shift in Spainï¿½s political climate in the 1930s, Cristï¿½bal Balenciaga moved his already noted haute couture business to Paris, taking up position in 1937 at 10 Avenue George V, adjacent to Avenue Montaigne. The Houseï¿½s modern Paris flagship store still operates from this address. For more than 30 years, the House of Balenciaga flourished through its haute couture business as well as its fragrances and jewellery and was celebrated around the world as one of the most influential couture houses. The Houseï¿½s haute couture business was closed in 1968, and Cristï¿½bal Balenciaga died just a few years later. From then until the mid 1990s, the Balenciaga name became associated commercially primarily with the fragrance business. In the mid 1990s, the Paris-based owner determined to re-launch the fashion side of the brand as a support to their primary fragrance and licensing businesses. Nicolas Ghesquiï¿½re joined Balenciaga in 1995 as designer within the licensing team, building upon a decade of experience in the areas of ready-to-wear and knitwear with other brands. By 1997, he had taken over the creative helm of Balenciaga and set about revitalizing the brand. The international fashion world and the growing circle of Balenciaga aficionados rapidly marked Nicolas out as one of the worldï¿½s strongest up-and-coming designers. In 2001, Gucci Group acquired control of Balenciaga and partnered with Nicolas Chesquiï¿½re (as both Artistic Director and shareholder) to accelerate the worldwide development of Balenciaga. The company has modernized its production and commercial capabilities, while asserting its presence and brand identity through a strong network of shops and comers in Paris, London, New York, Los Angeles; Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong and other major fashion capitals. New product categories, among them bags and shoes, have been added to the widening ready-to-wear line-up for both women and men. There was some conflict within the house of Balenciaga on Nicolas Ghesquiere's designs. The Gucci group said that if Balenciaga didn't become profitable within the year 2007, they would replace him. Ghesquiï¿½re's F/W 2005 line showed that the house was not only profitable, but also attracted a number of celebrity customers including editor-in-chief at Vogue, Anna Wintour. Today, the brand is also famous for its line of motorcycle-inspired handbags, especially the famous ""Lariat"". Balenciaga currently owns only two boutiques in the United States their U.S. headquarters in New York on W 22nd St. as well as a store in Honolulu. They currently are in the process of leasing a spot in the Mandarin Oriental in Boston which is to open in Summer of 2008.

Bally,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/bally/,Milan,Italy,https://www.bally.com,['Carl Franz Bally'],Bally,"In 1851 Carl Franz Bally together with his brother founds ï¿½Bally & Coï¿½. in the Swiss hamlet of Schï¿½nenwald he employs German shoemakers who work in the basement of his own home, the ï¿½Haus zum Felsgartenï¿½. The first shoes are still entirely handmade but their manufacture is based on the division of labour. After initial problems with production and quality, in 1854 a factory is built in the centre of the village. When his brother Fritz leaves the business, Carl Franz Bally founds the company ï¿½C.F. Ballyï¿½. First stores open in Bern, Basle and Zurich and exports to South America begin. In 1868 Bally builds a new elastic ribbon factory and a water channel to provide water-driven turbine power for the first MacKay Sole sewing machine. In 1870 C.F. Bally Co. is at the top of the European shoe industry because of almost entire mechanization of its production. The company quickly expands and opens branches in Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Geneva and Paris. Ballyï¿½s shoes become more comfortable, graceful and fashionable, following strong influences from Paris. Though mass-produced, thanks to their excellent finish, quality of the material and refined decoration, Bally shoes already stand for luxury. As of 1880, Bally employs agents to sell its products in Alexandria, Barcelona, Beirut, Brussels, Bucharest, Cairo, Constantinople, Hamburg, Lisbon, Madrid, Marseille, Sofia and Vienna. In 1892 Carl Franz Bally hands over the business to his sons who rename it C.F. Bally and Sons. Bally begins using machines to join the upper and lower while most of the work is still done by hand. After a major adaptation to the needs of the market, the British retail organization, the London Shoe Co., is founded and stores open at New Bond Street and Victory Street. Initially baby shoes and silk dancing shoes were exported. The years after 1900 are determined by an economic boom and free trade without barriers. Important markets are built up in France, Germany, Austria and Italy. In 1907 Bally becomes a publicly help company ï¿½ C. F. Bally Co. Ltd. ï¿½ with a majority stake still in family hands. The Bally realm expands continuously, new production sites in France, new factories in Dottikon and Nidergï¿½sgen, tanneries in Argentina and retail stores in Switzerland are opened. In 1921 C.F. Bally AG is established as a holding company, comprising five separate divisions; retail, wholesale, production, tannery and real estate. Slowly the economic situation in Europe improves and Bally recovers form the crisis and increases both retail stores and production sites in all parts of the world. In Switzerland a retail sales company is founded, the Bally Arola AG. The world depression affects Ballyï¿½s shoe production and exports. With the celebration of Ballyï¿½s centenary in 1951 a period of boom years begins. Originally inspired by the elegant lifestyle of a luxury hotel, the Scribe, the ultimate menï¿½s dress shoe, joins the Bally line. The name derives from the prestigious Scribe Hotel in Paris, where Max Bally, grandson of C.F. Bally, resides during these years. As of 1965, increasing imports of low-priced shoes result in the saturation of the Swiss market and exports decline. Bally has to diversify and opens several industries, specialized in rubber, glues and other chemicals, which subsequently become independent. The company increases sales and extends its international distribution. As of 1976. Bally clothing handbags and other leather accessories are added to the product range. In 1977, for the first time in its history, Bally passed into non-family ownership. Werner K. Rey, a Swiss investor, purchased a majority stake that he quickly sold nine months later to Oerlikon-Bï¿½hrle Holding, a Swiss armaments manufacturer. The relevance of the Far East and the US market grows continuously, and in 1988 Bally Japan Ltd. is founded. Although volume and sales temporarily increase under the new management, the brand is diluted through inappropriate licensing agreements and improper distribution. The worldwide recession significantly affects Bally and a concentration of production sites becomes necessary. This implies the increased use of non-Bally components like heels, lasts and soles. In 1999 Oerlikon-Bï¿½hrle Holding Ltd. sells Bally to Texas Pacific Group, a private American equity fund. In 2001 Bally celebrates its 150th anniversary Today Bally is centralized at the companyï¿½s Caslano ï¿½based headquarters on Switzerlandï¿½s Lake Lugano, close to Milan. Ballyï¿½s new CEO Marc Franchini assembles an international design team to completely redefine the companyï¿½s image and product offering. In 2003 a new showroom in Milan is opened to facilitate the reception of worldwide press and buyers during runway shows and collection presentations. A new production structure is being put in place in order to ensure a high level of quality control. Shoes are mainly produced in Caslano, while development and coordination of accessory production takes place in Florence and ready-to-wear is being developed in Ancona. There are currently about 200 single-brand stores around the world, and Bally will continue to roll out new stores and refurbish existing units based on its newly developed store concept. Bally have now set up their womenswear line. Alessandro Dell'Aqua was the designer for some time in 2001 followed by Scott Fellows from 1999-2002. Melissa Maish had worked at Bally till 1999 before Fellows, and after he left, she was called back in 2002 to oversee womenswear design again.

With the death of Pierre Balmain in 1982, the torch was passed to Erik Mortensen - his personal assistant since 1951 and his closest colaborator - who maintained the House's traditions while developing and updating styles and designs in the spirit of its founder. When Erik Mortensen left the House of Balmain in July 1990, he was replaced by youthful Herve-Pierre, who served as designer from 1990 through 1993 for both the Haute Couture and ready-to-wear collections. In 1993, Oscar de la Renta took over the couture design for Balmain. He presented collections for Balmain for nearly 10 years, which were very successful. Oscar presented his last collection for Balmain in July 2002. In December 2001 Swiss-born Laurent Mercier (born 1966) took over Balmain ready-to-wear. Mercier is a witty and talented designer, whose own signature collection won critical acclaim. In November 2002, he was also appointed Artistic Director of Balmain Haute Couture division also. A surprise announcement in June 2003 from Balmain, said that Laurent Mercier will no longer be their designer. They would not be showing their couture collection in July as expected. In August, an announcement was made that Christophe Lebourg (born 1963) would be the new Artistic Director for Balmain. He made his debut during Paris Spring 2004 season. The company hit troubled times during 2004, lasting for two years wherein during that time it was forced to file bankruptcy. After two years of hiatus from the catwalk, Balmain came back during the Fall 2006 Paris ready-to-wear season (Feb 2006) under a new Creative Director Christophe Decarnin. In 2001 the House of Balmain was pleased to announce the appointment of Olivier Rousteing as its new Designer.

The company is now Italian-owned and based in Mogliano Veneto. For the company logo a portrait of a Phenix rising up as chosen as a symbol of the continuity through the times in the good and bad fate. The original product line consisted of waterproof garments for men and woman. At about this time Belstaff became the first company in the world to use a fabric that was totally waterproof but breathable, the now famous ï¿½Wax Cottonï¿½. This is an Egyptian cotton processed with natural oils that let it breathe easily and is still waterproof. The firm has always specialized in the production of technical garments for motorcyclists. During the thirties the company specialized in making technical garments wind-proof, rain-proof and resistant to heavy friction. Therefore they specialized in garments for aviators, bikers, army and for anyone living an active life outdoor. Together with protective clothing Belstaff also began to make  goggles, gloves boots, helmets and bags, all designed and evolved over the years to guarantee total protection and safety. Belstaff became a subsidiary of James Halstead in 1948ï¿½a company also famous in later years for the success of the Australian brand Driza-Bone. The firm's 75th anniversary signals a strong return to the American market by a brand considered the most long-established in clothing for bikers, together with Harley Davidson. In the 1980s, Belstaff diversified into the golf wear market. The company was hit hard by the textile crisis of the 1990s precipitating the closure of the Longton Stoke-on-Trent factory after previously closing its Silverdale site. Moving to Wellingborough, production was vastly reduced. Responsibility of collection design was given to Franco Malenotti. The range was also manufactured in Australia by a sister company Driza-Bone. The company grew again and in 1994 introduced Belfresh, a waterproof/breathable fabric. In 1996 Franco Malenotti founded Clothing Company in order to speed up Belstaff return to the tops. The response was immediate and the sales increased very quickly. In 2002, the joint venture with the Italian company began to bear fruit also at European level and Belstaff regained a high profile in markets where for many years it had been the uncontested leader. The Bags / Shoes Division were set up in the same year and soon became independent, achieving remarkable success. At the same time, the ï¿½Black Prince by Belstaffï¿½ Collection was relaunched for a younger target. In 2004, Belstaff International Ltd was taken over by the Clothing Company. In February 2005, Belstaff made a decisive entry into the world of fashion, making its dï¿½but on the runways in Milan.

Alessandro Berluti designed it, Torello transformed it over 30 years, Talbinio refined it and Olga reinvented it while clients over the years have ennobled it. Executed in a single piece of leather without apparent stitching, the lace-up court shoe is a historic and emblematic model that symbolises the Maison Berluti and is the purest expression of its assertive style. Olga Berluti, the only woman bespoke shoemaker in the world, having inherited the knowledge of her predecessors, Alessandro, Torello and Talbinio, only makes shoes for men and treats her clients as friends. The art of making to measure, which has always been practised here, has greatly contributed to the Houseï¿½s reputation and to that of its shoes, which a clientele of aficionados has raised to cult status. Berluti also offers prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter shoe collections and leather goods of unparalleled quality, comfort and creativity.",['https://www.facebook.com/Berluti'],"['Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2017']",['Torello Berluti'],1895.0,Berluti family

It specialises in the sale of hand-made suits. Master tailor Nazareno Fonticoli and his business partner Gaetano Savini opened their first suit shop in Rome's Via Barberini at the end of World War II. The company was named ""Brioni"" after the resort on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. Brioni's first fashion show was held in 1952 at the Pitti Palace, Florence. The show gave the company exposure to clients worldwide. In 1954, Brioni held a fashion show in New York City, followed by shows in eight other American cities. That year, Brioni opened new shops on both sides of the Atlantic. Umberto Angeloni took over as Chief Executive Officer in 1990, and started an expansion plan which saw the introduction of a womenswear line, and shops opening in locations such as Mumbai, St. Petersburg, and Baku. He also arranged for Brioni suits to appear in James Bond movies from 1995. However in 2006 the family replaced Angeloni with three joint CEO's : Antonella de Simone, descended from Fonticoli, Andrea Perrone, a descendant of Savini, and finance man Antonio Bianchini. As of at least August 2009, Andrea Perrone is the sole chief executive. In order to meet the demand of such a large clientele, Brioni opened a factory in Abruzzo, Italy, where expert tailors hand-sew jackets and trousers before adding the finishing touches by machine. Brioni also owns a shirt factory, a leather fashion house and a line of women's clothing. Brioni's 900 tailors create 200 models in different styles and sizes every year. A quarter of the production consists of made-to-measure tailored suits for an elite of 25,000 customers. Each garment requires at least 30-35 hours of work, and there are more than 5,000 different fabrics to choose from. An off the peg suit costs about $5,000 at the entry-level; and most custom-tailored suits range from $6,000 to $46,000. As of February of 2009, Brioni is currently offering a $43,000 pinstripe suit made of the some of the world's rarest fabrics including the astronomically expensive wool of the vicuï¿½a, a rare South American relative of the llama. The suit's pinstripe stitching are genuine white gold. Tailors must go through a four year apprenticeship; and it is speculated that they must be able to create a suit blindfolded, although no reference from Brioni supports the statement. As of January 2007, Brioni owned 25 boutiques, which accounted for about 20% of sales. There were a further 13 franchised stores.

Brooks Brothers,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/brooks-brothers/,New York,USA,https://www.brooksbrothers.com,['Henry Sands Brooks'],Retail Brand Alliance,"Brooks Brothers is the oldest men's clothier chain in the United States. On April 7, 1818, at the age of 45, Henry Sands Brooks opened H. & D.H. Brooks & Co. on the Northeast corner of Catherine and Cherry Streets in New York City. Brooks Brothers introduced the first ready-to-wear suits in America. Pioneers of the 1849 California Gold Rush, unable to wait on the whims of a tailor, flocked to Brooks Brothers to pick up ready-made clothing. In 1850, his three sons, Elisha, Daniel, and John, inherited the family business and renamed the company ""Brooks Brothers In its early history, Brooks Brothers was most widely known for introducing the ready-to-wear suit to American customers. In the late nineteenth century, Brooks Brothers tailored many distinctive uniforms for elite regiments of the New York National Guard, as well as uniforms for New York State troops during the Civil War On 1850 the Golden Fleece symbol was adopted as the company's trademark. A sheep suspended in a ribbon had long been a symbol of British woolen merchants. Dating from the 15th century, it had been the emblem of the Knights of the Golden Fleece, founded by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. In ancient Greek mythology, a magical flying ram, or Golden Fleece, was sought by Jason and the Argonauts. A second New York City store opened on the corner of Broadway and Grand Street in 1958. This location closed in 1869, and moved temporarily to Union Square, and then to Broadway and Bond Street. The last member of the Brooks family to head the company was Winthrop Holly Brooks, who ran the company from 1935 until its sale in 1946, when the company was acquired by Julius Garfinckel & Co. Although Winthrop Brooks remained with the company as a figurehead, after the acquisition, John C. Wood became the director of Brooks Brothers. Just prior to that, Wood had been the carrier of the papers for the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. Under the leadership of Wood, Brooks Brothers became even more traditional. In 1949, Brooks Brothers finally devoted a small corner of the store to a womenï¿½s department. By 1969, ten Brooks Brothers stores were in operation and located in Manhattan, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C. as an integral part of the retail conglomerate Garfinckel, Brooks Brothers, Miller & Rhoads, Inc., that held the company until 1981 when it was acquired by Allied Stores. Brooks Brothers was acquired by the British firm Marks and Spencer plc in 1988. Retail Brand Alliance purchased Brooks Brothers from Marks & Spencer in 2001. Claudio Del Vecchio is CEO of Brooks Brothers. Mr. Del Vecchio assembled a team which shared his vision of returning quality, value, and heritage to Brooks Brothers clothing. Like many things quintessentially American, Brooks Brothers was very well received in Japan. Their flagship store in Aoyama opened in 1979, spreading classic American style across continents. By 1997, sixty-two stores accompanied it. The new line of lifestyle clothing, introduced in April of 2003, met standards of quality, comfort and class. Not strictly for golf or tennis, this tightly focused line of clothing is designed for easy movement from the course to the clubhouse and on to the dining room. n 2003, Brooks Brothers opened its 22,000-square-foot West Coast flagship at 468 Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Brooks Brothers opened its first store in the United Kingdom with a small store in Lion's Plaza in London's Financial District. Less than a year later, an 11,000-square-foot flagship was opened on fashionable Regent Street. Brooks Brothers made its French debut with an 8,000-square-foot, two-level store on Paris' historic Rue St. Honore. In 2008, Brooks Brothers bought a partnership stake in a 230 year-old cashmere mill in Innerleithen, Scotland,and today produces all of its cashmere knitwear at the historic mill. In May 2009, Brooks Brothers opened its first store in Canada on Alberni Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. An East Coast Canadian debut was made in September in Royal Bank Plaza in Toronto, Ontario. The first store in Mexico opened a few weeks later in Guadalajara, with a flagship planned to open in Mexico City's Antara Mall later in 2009.",['https://www.facebook.com/BrooksBrothers'],"['Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2016']",[],1850.0,Henry Sands Brooks

Carven,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/carven/,Paris,France,https://www.carven.fr,['Carven Tommasso'],Harlant Group,"Established in 1945 by Madame Carven, wife of Swiss industrialist Réné Grog (1896-1981), the House of Carven originally catered to the petite woman. The move was bold and innovative during that time. Niche market targeting was almost unheard of. But Madame Carven who stood only 1m55 believed that petite woman should be able to dress up well also. Today the Carven label can be found throughout the world as a result of extensive distribution of licensed products and especially Carven's perfume Ma Griffe, in its familiar white and green packaging. Madame Carven always includes a signature white and green dress in her collections, which, to this day, stand for a tasteful style of charm and beauty that complements the wearer no matter her proportions. The late 1990s were a period of change for the House of Carven. In 1995 the company was reorganized, with the perfume, couture and accessories divisions merged and Angelo Tarlazzi taking over as artistic director of couture. Three years later, in 1998, the Daniel Harlant Group, a French perfume firm, acquired Carven, whose financial performance was marred by a large amount of debt. Although Harlant was thought to be mainly interested in Carven's fragrance line, it focused on the house's couture activities as well, hiring Edward Achour as artistic director the same year it purchased the company. The Harlant Group also expanded Carven's licensing activity, signing a large ready-to-wear partner almost immediately. Carven is operate independently from the Harlant Group's other businesses. Carven has attempted to reverse its somewhat conservative image in the fragrance category, the area for which the company is probably best known on a global basis, especially in North America. Company executives told Women's Wear Daily in December 2000 that the perfume division hoped to emulate the changes that had occurred since Achour had taken over in couture. His creations appeal to a younger consumer than Carven has historically attracted. The fragrance division began to reposition itself in the late 1990s, introducing the men's fragrance Carven Homme to target male consumers in their 30s, an unfilled niche for the house. A new women's scent, Variations, launched in 2001, was aimed at the same age bracket among females. In terms of marketing, Carven has long supported its image by sponsoring events appealing to its upscale clientéle, including book fairs, horse races, and sailing and golf competitions. It continues this tradition today and also gives back to the fashion industry by offering grants to assist young designers just getting started. Even without the active participation of Madame Carven since the mid-1990s, Carven maintains its haute couture image around the world. This profile is not only furthered by its seasonal collections but, perhaps even more, by a wide range of licensed luxury products, including leather goods, fragrances, jewelry, watches, pens, cognac and champagne, carpets, porcelain, furniture, corporate gifts, and uniforms.

Chanel,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/chanel/,Paris,France,https://www.chanel.com,['Gabrielle Chanel'],Alain Wertheimer and Gerard Wertheimer,"Chanel S.A., commonly known as ""Chanel"", is a Parisian fashion house founded by the late couturier Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel, recognized as one of the most established in haute couture, specializing in luxury goods (haute couture, ready-to-wear, handbags, perfumery, and cosmetics among others). According to Forbes, the privately held House of Chanel is jointly owned by Alain Wertheimer and Gerard Wertheimer who are the great-grandsons of the early (1924) Chanel partner Pierre Wertheimer. Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel heralded new designs and revolutionized the fashion industry by going ""back to basics"", incorporating elegance, class, and originality. Under her tight reign from 1909ï¿½1971, Coco Chanel held the title as 'Chief Designer' until her death on January 10, 1971. In 1909, Gabrielle Chanel opened a shop on the ground floor of Balsan's apartment in Paris, which was a meeting place of the hunting elite of France. The gentlemen brought their fashionable mistresses along to the apartment which gave Coco the opportunity to sell her decorated hats to the women. Arthur 'Boy' Capel who was in a relationship with Coco saw a businesswoman in her and helped her acquire a location at 31 Rue Cambon in Paris by 1910. In 1913, Chanel introduced women's sportswear at her new boutique in Deauville and Biarritz, France. During World War I, Coco opened another larger shop on Rue Cambon in front of the Hï¿½tel Ritz Paris. 1921 saw the introduction of her first perfume Chanel No. 5. Earnest Beaux created the fragrance for Coco and she named it after her lucky number 5. The fragrance was a success. Parfums Chanel was founded in 1924 by Pierre Wertheimer to produce and sell perfumes and beauty products. Theophile Bader (founder of the successful French department store Galeries Lafayette) introduced Coco to Wertheimer. Wertheimer retained 70% of Parfums Chanel, while Bader retained 20%, and Coco a modest 10%. Coco was forced to operate her couture business apart from Parfums Chanel. In 1924, Coco also introduced her first costume jewelry which was a pair of pearl earrings, one black, one white. Along with the success of her haute couture business, Coco expanded her ""social desirability and her personal legend."" A new love interest in her life was the Duke of Westminster. She introduced her signature cardigan jacket in 1925 and in 1926, the ï¿½little black dress,' and a tweed, inspired by visits to Scotland. Soon, Coco operated a boutique near the Louvre. As the couture Chanel and Parfums Chanel gained success, business relations between Coco and Pierre were sour. She resented the partnership with Pierre Wertheimer and believed she deserved more than 10% of the profits, and believed that the Wertheimers were exploiting her talents for their own personal gain. Coco designed a line for petite women in 1937. Throughout the 1930s, Elsa Schiaparelli was competing more strongly with the House of Chanel, but this was only a short term rivalry. Chanel premiered an exhibition of jewelry in 1932 dedicated to the diamond. When World War II began in 1939, Coco Chanel retired and moved into the Hï¿½tel Ritz Paris with her new beau, Nazi officer Hans Gunther von Dincklage. Only her parfums and accessories were sold in her existing boutiques. During World War II Pierre Wertheimer and his family fled to the United States in 1940, and before Coco could take control of Parfums Chanel, Wertheimer made an ""Aryan proxy"" for the company. Coco Chanel fled to Switzerland at this time, where she out of spite created her own collection of perfumes. Wertheimer felt his legal rights were infringed, but he wanted to avoid a legal battle and settled with Coco by giving her $400,000 USD, 2% royalty from all Chanel products, and gave her limited rights to sell her own perfumes in Switzerland. Coco stopped making perfumes after the agreement. She sold the complete rights to her name to the Wertheimers for Perfumes Chanel, in exchange for a monthly stipend. The stipend supported her and her friend, von Dincklage. Chanel returned to Paris in 1953 and became competitive again would necessarily come at a great price; Chanel needed to be a significant presence in: haute couture, pret-a-porter, costume jewelry and fragrance. Coco swallowed her pride and re-approached Pierre for business advice and financial backing. In return, he negotiated for himself complete rights to all products bearing the brand: ""Chanel."" Importantly for the brand and starting in 1953, Coco collaborated with jeweler Robert Goossens to design a line of Chanel jewelry which exquisitely complimented her iconic fashion designs. She also introduced the Chanel gold or metallic chain-strapped and quilted leather handbags in February 1955. Her first venture into men's fragrance, Chanel's eau de toilette for men, Pour Monsieur  became endured and remains even today the number one selling men's fragrance. Pierre bought Bader's 20% share of the perfume business, giving his family 90%. Pierre's son Jacques Wertheimer took his father's place in 1965. Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel died on January 10, 1971 at the age of 87. She was still ""designing, still working"" at the time of her death. After her death, leadership of the company was handed down to Yvonne Dudel, Jean Cazaubon and Philippe Guibourge. The House continued average success, and Jacques Wetheimer bought the entire House of Chanel. In 1974, the House of Chanel launched Cristalle eau de toilette, which was designed when Coco Chanel was alive. 1978 saw the launch of the first non-couture, prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter line and worldwide distribution of accessories. Alain Wertheimer, Jacque's son, took over in 1974. Looking for a designer who could bring the label to new heights, he persuaded Karl Lagerfeld to end his contract with fashion house Chloï¿½ and in 1983 Lagerfeld took over as chief designer for Chanel. He changed Chanel's fashion lines from the old lines to shorter cuts and eye capturing designs. During the 1980s, more than 40 Chanel boutiques were opened up worldwide. By the end of the 1980s, these boutiques sold goods ranging from US$200-per-ounce perfume, US$225 ballerina slippers to US$11,000 dresses and US$2,000 leather handbags. Rights to Chanel cosmetics and fragrances were held by Chanel only and not shared with other beauty producers and distributors. The launch of a new fragrance in honor of the late Coco Chanel, Coco, in 1984 maintained success in the perfumery business with Chanel. In 1986, the House of Chanel struck a deal with watchmakers and in 1987, the first Chanel watch made its debut. By the end of the decade, Alain moved the offices to New York City. The company earned the place as a global leader in fragrance maker and marketing in the 1990s. Heavy marketing investment increased revenue. The success of the Maison de Chanel brought the Wertheimer family fortune to $5 billion USD. Product lines such as watches (retailing for as much as $7,000 USD), shoes, high-end clothes, cosmetics and accessories were expanded. Sales were hurt by the recession of the early 1990s, but Chanel recovered by the mid-1990s with further boutique expansion. 1990 saw the launch of Ä¹Å¹. As the business trend was going about (buying up other fashion companies), Chanelï¿½like Moï¿½t-Hennessy ï¿½ Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada -- bought up numerous companies. The House acquired Les Broderies Lemariï¿½, A. Michael et Cie, and Lesage. Chanel was also rumored to also buy the company Massaro. By 1996, Chanel bought gunmaker Holland & Holland. It attempted to revamp the guns maker but did not succeed. 1996 also greeted the launch of Allure fragrance and due to its immense popularity, a men's version, Allure Homme was launched in 1998. Better success came with the purchase of Eres (a swimwear label). The House of Chanel launched its first skin care line, PRï¿½CISION in 1999. That same year, Chanel launched a new travel collection, and under a license contract with Luxottica, introduced a line of sunglasses and eyeglass frames. While Alain Wertheimer remained chairman of Chanel, CEO and President Franï¿½oise Montenay was to bring Chanel into the 21st century. In 2001, Bell & Ross was purchased (a watchmaker). The same year, Chanel boutiques offering only selections of accessories were opened in the United States. 2002 saw the launch of Chance fragrance, with a scent of surprise and glamour. The House of Chanel also founded the Paraffection company that gathered the five Ateliers dï¿½Art: Desrues for ornamentation, Lemariï¿½ for feathers and camellias, Lesage for embroidery, Massaro for shoemaking, and Michel for millinery. A prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter collection proposing their know-how was designed by Karl Lagerfeld. It is now traditionally presented each December. In July 2002, a jewelry and watch flagship store was opened on the upscale Madison Avenue. Within months, a 1,000sqft shoes and handbags boutique was opened next door to the Jewelry and watches flagship. Chanel continued to expand in the United States and by December 2002, it operated 25 U.S. boutiques. In order to please the younger followers, Chanel introduced Coco Mademoiselle and an ""In-Between Wear"" in 2003. That same year saw such an immense popularity of Chanel haute couture that the company founded a second shop on rue Cambon. Continuing an influence in the Asian market, the House of Chanel opened a new 2,400 Square feet boutique in Hong Kong and paid nearly $50 million USD for a building in the classy and upscale shopping district of Ginza in Tokyo, Japan.",['https://www.facebook.com/chanel'],"['Cruise 2025', 'Resort 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2024', 'Pre-Fall 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Resort 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Pre-Fall 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Resort 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Pre-Fall 2022', 'Pre-Fall 2021', 'Autumn/Winter 2021', 'Spring/Summer 2021', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Cruise 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Pre-Fall 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2019', 'Resort 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Pre-Fall 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Cruise 2018', 'Pre-Fall 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Cruise 2017', 'Pre-Fall 2017', 'Pre-Fall 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Resort 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Pre-Fall 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Pre-Fall 2015', 'Resort 2015', 'Cruise 2014', 'Pre-Fall 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Pre-Fall 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Resort 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Pre-Fall 2012', 'Resort 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Cruise 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Pre-Fall 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Pre-Fall 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Cruise 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Cruise 2009', 'Pre-Fall 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Cruise 2008', 'Pre-Fall 2008', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2007', 'Cruise 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Spring/Summer 2006', 'Spring/Summer 2005', 'Autumn/Winter 2005', 'Autumn/Winter 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2002', 'Spring/Summer 2002', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2000', 'Spring/Summer 1998', 'Autumn/Winter 1998', 'Spring/Summer 1997', 'Autumn/Winter 1997', 'Spring/Summer 1996', 'Autumn/Winter 1996', 'Spring/Summer 1995', 'Autumn/Winter 1995', 'Autumn/Winter 1994', 'Spring/Summer 1994', 'Spring/Summer 1993', 'Autumn/Winter 1993', 'Autumn/Winter 1992', 'Spring/Summer 1992', 'Autumn/Winter 1991']","['Gabrielle Chanel', 'Karl Otto Lagerfeld']",1909.0,"Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel"

Chloe,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/chloe/,Paris,France,https://www.chloe.fr,['Jacques Lenoir and Gaby Aghion'],,"2002 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the house of Chloe. In the half-century since it was founded, the prestigious French label has stayed true to the concept of romantic, feminine fashion. Today, the houses newest Creative Director, Phoebe Philo, will bring her unique vision to this label at a moment when Chloe is enjoying unprecedented success. After fifty years, Chloe continues to connect with a new generation of stylish women. The house of Chloe was founded in 1952 by two Parisians, Jacques Lenoir and Gaby Aghion. In a rapidly modernising post-war world, old traditions were giving way to new ideas, and their proposition was a radical one: they would make luxury pret--porter, delivering the kind of exceptional fashion off the rack that, until then, had only been available as couture. The romantic, fluid clothes that they created marked a bold departure from the stiff formality of womens fashion in the early fifties. Chic, sensual, and unmistakably French, Chloe immediately established itself as a house that celebrated a softer aesthetic. In 1963, the houses founders appointed Karl Lagerfeld as head designer. Under Lagerfelds direction, the Chloe label produced iconic fashion: the gauzy floral prints and fluid, floating shapes that he created defined the bohemian spirit of the seventies and made Chloe one of the most popular labels of the period. This era also saw the launch of the Chloe fragrance. Chloe, introduced in 1974, was an immediate commercial success, and continues to be one of the worlds best selling fragrances today. In 1985, the Swiss-based luxury group Richemont Group bought the house from Aghion and Lenoir, and setting the company up for expansion on the international market. In the late eighties, Martine Sitbon helmed the house, bringing her uniquely modern vision of womens fashion to the label. Lagerfeld returned to the house in 1992, and for the next five years he consistently reinvented the Chloe woman, dressing her in delicately torn neo-classical dresses, and bright hippie-inspired lace. In the last five years, the house has undergone a dramatic period of growth. In 1997, the then twenty-six year old Stella McCartney took over as Creative Director. In a period that saw a new generation of customers embracing luxury fashion, McCartneys youthful, spirited sensibility re-energized Chloe and made it highly desirable once again. Infusing Chloes classic soft, romantic spirit with the pulse of the street, McCartney effortlessly mixed delicately feminine pieces with structured tailoring, putting flirtatious camisoles under skinny, tailored suits and pairing revealing blouses with low-riding jeans and stiletto heels. This vision of the new Chloe woman hit a chord with young women around the world, and proved hugely successful. McCartney announced her departure from Chloï¿½ in early 2001, naming 27-year-old Phoebe Philo as her successor. The move left most in the fashion industry baffled, as Philo was a relative unknown. She had attended Central St. Martins a year behind McCartney and worked under her for only four years, but did not have the credentials typical of designers at any other major house. Planted firmly at the intersection of casual street chic and whimsical femininity, Philoï¿½s first collection forged an image that the company calls ""luxurious, romantic and quinessentially French."" Philo also created several ""it bags"" during her time at Chloï¿½, including the Paddington bag, which became a smash hit in 2004 and spawned many knockoffs. On January 6, 2006, Philo announced that she was stepping down as creative director for the fashion house in order to spend more time with her young daughter. Having played a pivotal role in the reinvention of Chloe, the young British designer will continue to grow the brand, launching new categories of merchandise such as accessories and swimwear, and developing the secondary line, See by Chloe. Chloï¿½ announced in October 2006 that Paulo Melim Andersson, a Swede who worked for Marni for seven years, would take over as creative director. ï¿½His mission is to find the new direction for the Chloï¿½ brand,ï¿½ Chloï¿½ chairman and chief executive Ralph Toledano told WWD. ï¿½He will be given, like his predecessors, a lot of freedom to find his own way.ï¿½ Andersson has shown three collections for Chloe each exemplifying an edgier, abstract quirkiness to a line which has long been associated with romantic, girly Parisian notions. Andersson latest fall 2008 collection fulfilled elements of Chloe's charm like tea dresses and ruffled edges, however, the collection was met with mixed reviews. Paula Melim Andersson is an example of a designer with a tremendous amount of talent, however, not the right fit for Chloe despite a 9% increase in Chloe sales during his 2006-2007 year. Hannah MacGibbon who worked under Phoebe Philo for 5 years prior to Andersson has been neamed the new creative director. Alas, Chloe is back in a woman's hands.",['https://www.facebook.com/chloe.paris.fashion'],"['Spring/Summer 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2021', 'Spring/Summer 2021', 'Resort 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Pre-Fall 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Pre-Fall 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Resort 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Pre-Fall 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Resort 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2007', 'Spring/Summer 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2005', 'Spring/Summer 2005', 'Spring/Summer 2004', 'Autumn/Winter 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2002', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2000', 'Autumn/Winter 1999', 'Autumn/Winter 1998', 'Spring/Summer 1998', 'Spring/Summer 1997', 'Spring/Summer 1996', 'Autumn/Winter 1996', 'Spring/Summer 1995', 'Autumn/Winter 1995', 'Spring/Summer 1994', 'Autumn/Winter 1994', 'Autumn/Winter 1993', 'Spring/Summer 1993', 'Autumn/Winter 1992', 'Spring/Summer 1992', 'Autumn/Winter 1991', 'Spring/Summer 1988']","['Gaby Aghion', 'Yvan Mispelaere']",1952.0,Jacques Lenoir

Inacio had done some design work in Brazil before joining St. Martins, Suzanne had studied fine arts.

Coach,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/coach/,New York,USA,https://www.coach.com,['Miles Cahn & Lillian Cahn'],Sara Lee Corporation,"Coach, Inc. is an American leather goods company known for ladies' and men's handbags. During the last decade, Coach has emerged as America's preeminent designer, producer, and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men including handbags, womenï¿½s and menï¿½s small leathergoods, business cases, weekend and travel accessories, outerwear, scarves, jewelry, fragrance and related accessories. Continued development of new categories has further established the signature style and distinctive identity of the Coach brand. Together with their licensing partners, they also offer watches, footwear, and sunwear bearing the Coach brand name. Coach was founded in 1941, in a loft in Manhattan, New York. When it originated, Coach was called Manhattan Leather Bags. Manhattan Leather Bags began as a family-owned business, with six leatherworkers who made small leather goods, such as wallets and handbags. In 1946, Miles Cahn and his wife Lillian joined the company. Miles and Lillian Cahn were owners of a leather handbag manufacturing business, and were knowledgeable about leatherworks and business. By 1950, Cahn had taken over the business and was running it mainly himself. The workers continued to manufacture small leather goods, like wallets, for small profits into the 1960s. In the 1960s, Cahn did further research on leather and discovered a very complex method for processing leather to make it strong, soft, and durable. At the suggestion of his wife, a number of women's handbags were designed to be more affordable. The purses got the brand name Coach in the 1960s. Coach women's handbags were made out of sturdy cowhide, which was of much better quality than the thin leather pasted over cardboard material that was used to make other handbags at the time. This catapulted Coach to a prominent standing among high quality leather products. During the 1960s, Cahn hired Bonnie Cashin to work for Coach. Cashin was already a well-known fashion designer prior to joining Coach; however, this deal proved to be one of her most well-known business alliances. Cashin worked for Coach from 1962 until 1974, and revolutionized their product design. Business was strong throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Products were in high demand, and under a new vice president for special products, Coach had started a mail-order business. They had also owned specialty stores, and began to sell Coach bags outside of department stores. Sales increased, and soon demand was greater than the supply. Eventually, Coach would restrict sales to hand selected vendors. In 1979, Lew Frankfort, Coach's current CEO, joined the company as vice-president of business development. In July 1986, Coach was sold to Sara Lee Corporation for $30 million dollars. Sara Lee took over the factory, the 6 boutiques, and its main store on Madison Avenue in New York City. Shortly after, new boutiques were opened in Macy's stores in New York and San Francisco. Additional Coach stores were under constructed in Denver and Seattle, and similar boutiques were to be opened in other major department stores later in the year. Coach also opened mall storefronts in New York, New Jersey, Texas, and California. By November, the company was operating 12 stores, along with nearly 50 boutiques within larger department stores. Coach Inc. currently has distribution, product development and quality control operations in the United States, Italy, Hong Kong, China and South Korea. Coachï¿½s distribution strategy is multi-channel. There are currently over 400 Coach stores in the United States and Canada, with more slated to open this calendar year. In addition, Coach has built a strong presence in the United States through Coach boutiques, that carry full Coach collections, including women's footwear, men's briefcases and the new jewelry line, located within select department stores and specialty retailer locations. Six are located in New York City and two in Hawaii. Other locations are in East Hampton, NY, Philadelphia, Nashville, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Palo Alto, Scottsdale, Seattle, Washington D.C., and Westchester County, New York. In 1999, Coach launched its online store at www.coach.com and evolved it into an important sales channel in the United States, and an effective marketing and advertising vehicle for Coach both domestically and abroad. While Coach continues to be one of the most recognized accessories brands in the United States, its long-term strategic plan is to increase international distribution and target international consumers. Through Coach Japan, wholly owned by Coach since 2005, the company leverages a large growth opportunity in this important market for imported handbags and accessories. Similarly, the Company acquired its retail businesses in Hong Kong, Macau and Mainland China in 2009. As this emerging market rapidly grows, the Coach brand enjoys increased recognition. Intent on maintaining a consistent brand strategy domestically and abroad, this ownership structure provides Coach with complete control of its distribution in Japan and China. With a global vision in place, Coach is available at over 900 department store locations in the United States, 159 international department stores, retail stores and duty free shops in over 20 countries, 155 department store shop-in-shops and retail and factory stores operated by Coach Japan, and 28 company-operated locations in China.

Comme Des Garcons,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/comme-des-garcons/,Paris,France,https://www.comme-des-garcons.com/,['Rei Kawakubo'],Rei Kawakubo,"Comme des Garçons, French for ""like boys"", is a Japanese fashion label headed by Rei Kawakubo, who is also its sole owner. Comme des Garçons has a dozen boutiques and approximately 200 vendors around the world, with flagship stores in Aoyama, Tokyo's high fashion district, as well as Place Vendôme in Paris. Each year, the company grosses in the neighborhood of $150 million. The label was started in Tokyo by Rei Kawakubo in 1969 and established as a company in Japan in 1973. Comme des Garçons became successful in Japan throughout the 1970s and a men's line was added in 1978. 1981 saw Comme des Garçons's debut show in Paris which created a storm of controversy for its predominant use of black and distressed fabrics. Throughout the 1980s, Comme des Garçons's clothes were often destroyed. After the Paris debut, Comme des Garçons had an exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1986 consisting of photographs taken by Peter Lindbergh. 2005 saw an exhibition in Shinjuku, Tokyo of Comme Des Garçons advertising and graphic design. Comme des Garçons collections are designed in the Comme des Garçons studio in Aoyama, Tokyo and are made in Japan, France and Turkey. The 1997 spring/summer collection, often referred to the 'lumps and bumps' collection, which contained fabric in bulk and balls on the garments. This led to a collaboration, also in 1997, between Rei Kawakubo and New York-based choreographer Merce Cunningham called 'Scenario'. The 2006 autumn/winter collection dealt with the concept of the 'yssup', the different ways we present ourselves to the sinep. Fusing tailored menswear with more feminine elements such as corsets and flower printed dress fabrics, 'Persona' was another collection that combined the feminine with the masculine by Comme des Garçons. Junya Watanabe and, as of recently, Tao Kurihara have started their own sub-labels under the Comme des Garçons name to much acclaim. Both were also involved in designing for the casual women's knitwear line 'Comme des Garçons Tricot'. Comme des Garçons have collaborated with various other labels over the years including Levi's, Speedo, Nike, Moncler, Lacoste, Cutler and Gross, Chrome Hearts, Hammerthor, S. N. S. Herning, Louis Vuitton and many others. Comme des Garçons and H&M collaborated on a collection which was released in the fall of 2008 Signature Comme des Garçons boutiques are located in London (Dover Street Market), Paris, New York City, Beijing, Hong Kong, St. Petersburg, Tokyo (2x), Kyoto, Osaka and Fukuoka. The company also maintains stores-in-store at select department stores, such as Isetan. In Paris, a Comme des Garçons perfumery can be found at 23 Place Marché St-Honoré. Comme des Garçons opened the first of their 'Guerrilla' stores in 2004 in Berlin. The Guerrilla stores' aim is to be open for only one year and to spend a minimal amount of money on the interiors. The stores are also to be located away from fashionable hubs and districts of a city. Comme des Garçons Guerrilla stores have been opened (and subsequently closed) in Reykjavik, Warsaw, Helsinki, Singapore, Stockholm and Athens, amongst others. In July 2007, a Guerrilla Store opened in the Achrafieh district of Beirut, Lebanon, and in February 2008, a Guerrilla Store opened in downtown Los Angeles, the first in the United States. In November 2008, they opened their latest guerilla store in the west end of Glasgow. It is believed this could be their last shop of this kind. 2004 saw the opening of Dover Street Market (DSM) in London. A multilevel store conceptualised by Rei Kawakubo. As well as selling Comme Des Garçons lines, other designers are personally invited and ""accorded 'creative spaces'"" by Rei Kawakubo to open a section of the store and design it in any way they wish while often selling limited edition pieces made only for DSM. On December 2009, Comme des Garçons opened a 4.400 square feet store in Hong Kong called UNDER THE GROUND . Hong Kong also has had a Guerrilla store opened and closed in previous years.",['https://www.instagram.com/commedesgarconsparfums'],"['Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Spring/Summer 1997', 'Autumn/Winter 1997', 'Autumn/Winter 1995', 'Spring/Summer 1995', 'Autumn/Winter 1994', 'Spring/Summer 1993', 'Autumn/Winter 1992', 'Spring/Summer 1992', 'Spring/Summer 1991', 'Autumn/Winter 1991']",['Rei Kawakubo'],1969.0,Rei Kawakubo

Later they went on a round the world bike trip and returned to Barcelona impressed and inspired by the Californian lifestyle and the bold and sometimes psychedelic surf wear they had seen there. It was from this that a few years on Custo was born. The business was started in 1996 when the brothers had realised that there was a niche in the market for bright, well-designed, funky T shirts, with the emphasis on creativity and individuality. At the time, minimalism was in fashion and the brothers were effectively taking quite a risk. They showed their first collection at the 1997 New York fashion week and the business has never looked back. The brothers continue to expand their horizons, having recently expanded to include handbag and denim lines. Custo now has some 3000 points of sale worldwide, including world famous stores such as SAKS NY.

Diesel,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/diesel/,Breganze,Italy,https://www.diesel.com,['Renzo Rosso'],,"Diesel has long been a leading pioneer in denim and casual fashion, known for moving outside and ahead of trends in its industry. While retaining always its DNA, in recent years Diesel has evolved into the world of premium casual wear, becoming a true alternative to the established luxury market. Despite Dieselï¿½s extraordinary growth, its philosophy is the same as when Renzo Rosso created it in 1978: he envisaged a brand that would stand for passion, individuality and self-expression. With the recent appointment of Nicola Formichetti as its Artistic Director, the brand is ready to ï¿½rebootï¿½ and continues to blaze its own trail. The collections include: Diesel, Diesel Black Gold (the contemporary line designed by Andreas Melbostad), 55DSL (a streetwear collection under the creative direction of Andrea Rosso), Diesel Kid. Diesel is not just apparel and denim: itï¿½s a lifestyle, which has been interpreted through licences with leading brands to develop watches and jewellery (with Fossil), eyewear (with Marcolin), fragrances (with Lï¿½Oreal), helmets (with AGV), headphones (with Monster), bikes (with Pinarello) and a complete home collection (with Foscarini, Moroso, Zucchi and Scavolini). Diesel is a truly worldwide organisation. From its headquarters in Breganze (Vicenza), it directly manages 19 subsidiaries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. It is present in more than 80 countries with 5,000 points of sale, including more than 400 company owned stores. Diesel is part of OTB, the holding company of Maison Martin Margiela, Marni, Viktor&Rolf and Staff International, a synonym of prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter Made in Italy (and managing the licenses of brands like DSquared, Just Cavalli, Vivienne Westwood Red Label and Man, and Marc Jacobs Men). The brand is famous worldwide also for its provoking ads: in the course of years, they have generated shock, laughter and disbelief, as well as shelf-loads of awards, as the Gold, Grand Prix, and Advertiser of the Year awards at the prestigious Cannes International Advertising festival. The Company has received numerous awards also for the business model it proposes. In 1996, Renzo Rosso and Diesel received the ï¿½Premio Risultatiï¿½ award from the prestigious Bocconi Institute in Milan for being the ï¿½Best Italian Company of the Yearï¿½. Renzo Rosso was also nominated, by North American division of Ernst & Young, as ï¿½Entrepreneur of the Yearï¿½ for 1997 for the companyï¿½s progressive moves in the U.S. On July 2000, CUOA Foundation (Italyï¿½s first and most renowned MBA program) conferred an honorary master in business administration to Renzo Rosso, calling Diesel ï¿½one of the entrepreneurial phenomena of the 90ï¿½sï¿½. In December 2000, Diesel snatched New Yorkï¿½s ï¿½Made in Italy Awardï¿½ in the Fashion Innovation category, while in 2001 Renzo Rosso was designated ï¿½Entrepreneur of the Year - Innovation categoryï¿½ by Ernst & Young. In November 2003, Hollywoodï¿½s Movieline magazine awarded Renzo with its ï¿½Original Vision Awardï¿½ for his long term success in communication and advertising. In November 2004, in Montecarlo, Rosso received the ï¿½International Leading Entrepreneur Awardï¿½. In Jan. 2005 the University of Verona conferred him a master ad honorem in Supply Chain Integration Management, in February Romeï¿½s Major Walter Veltroni awarded him for his ï¿½creative vision of businessï¿½, in May Germanyï¿½s Textilwirtschaft gave him the ï¿½Forum-Preisï¿½ for his outstanding personal and entrepreneurial performance. In June, inside the historical Fortezza del Basso in Florence, Renzo Rosso received the prestigious prize ï¿½Pitti Immagine Uomoï¿½ and in November, the ï¿½GQ Man of the yearï¿½ award from GQ Germany. In 2006, Hollywood Life magazine has named Renzo Rosso, the president and founder of Diesel, as the ""Fashion Visionary"" at the 3rd Annual Hollywood Style Awards, as one of the most innovative and successful brands in fashion. In 2010, Renzo Rosso has been named a Millennium Promise MDG Global Leader, together with personalities such as Tommy Hilfiger and Youssou Nï¿½Dour, while the company was awarded a Gold Lion at Cannes for its Be Stupid campaign. Renzo Rosso created the Diesel brand in 1978, choosing the name because it is easy to understand, pronounced the same way around the world, and has a rugged feel about it; at that time, Diesel was also considered an ï¿½alternative energyï¿½ so it was representative of an alternative taste in casual wear. In 1985 Renzo Rosso acquired sole control of Diesel and surrounded himself with an international team of talented designers and staff. Diesel launched its first ï¿½For Successful Livingï¿½ advertising campaign in 1991, instantly establishing a reputation for innovative marketing.

Diesel also creates a kids and sportswear line. The company was founded by Renzo Rosso and his former boss Adriano Goldschmied (of the AG Jeans company) in 1978. Diesel's milestone years include 1985 (Renzo's complete acquisition of the company), 1991 (beginning of the international marketing strategy) and 1996 (opening of Diesel's first flagship store on New York City's Lexington Avenue). Most of Diesel's current production is outsourced to small and medium-sized companies. Production of denim jeans is based mainly in Italy. The headquarters are located in Molvena, in the north-eastern part of Italy, where the company manages 17 subsidiaries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. The company owns more than 200 retail outlets worldwide and also wholesales to better retail boutiques and department stores, and has around 3,500 employees. Annual sales are approximately € 1.2 Billion according to 2005 figures. Denim sales make up the core of the Diesel S.p.A. brand's business. Brands like Diesel are part of a surge of small denim-based brands like True Religion, Seven for all Mankind, Rock and Republic and Paper Denim & Cloth to name a few. There are said to be over 700 denim-based brands in existence to date according to fashion industry trade-magazine Women's Wear Daily [WWD]. The Diesel name is licensed to other companies to produce footwear, leather goods, eye wear, jewelry, wristwatches produced by major time-piece brand and company Fossil, as well as fragrances (held by mega beauty company L'Oreal), and other accessories for men and women. In February 2007, the company launched a major intimates and beachwear division for men and women that is carried in the retail and department stores. The license is held by the US company Mast Industries Inc. who also produces lingerie for Victoria's Secret. Diesel has attracted press attention with controversial advertising campaigns. The most recent (Spring/Summer 2007) dubbed ""Global Warming Ready"" featuring images of cities such as Paris, London and Venice after global warming has taken place. The image for Paris shows the Eiffel Tower surrounded by a tropical rainforest with a man walking a lizard. In recent years the company has driven its attention to the youth market, by sponsoring several projects such as the Diesel-U-Music Contest or the Diesel Wall artistic programme, marketing their clothing in video games, or being main partner of a ITS Fashion Accessories and Photo competition ITS International Talent Supportor by participating in other actions, such as the 2006 edition of Life Ball, the Sundance Film Festival.",['https://www.facebook.com/Diesel'],"['Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Resort 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Autumn/Winter 2007', 'Spring/Summer 2007']",['Renzo Rosso'],1978.0,Renzo Rosso

In 1996, Ferragamo took over financial control of the Emanuel Ungaro house. Emanuel Ungaro has continued to design couture for his house, but the Spring 2002 was his last for ready-to-wear. He has passed the torch to a young designer named Gianbattista Valli (born 1967). Valli has worked for Roberto Capucci, Fendi and Krizia before joining Ungaro in 1997. He has been trained by Emanuel Ungaro to take over the design of the house. However, Ungaro has stressed in several interviews that he has no intention of retiring from design of couture. He is still brimming with creative ideas. At the end of October 2004, Giambattista Valli announced that he would be leaving the house of Ungaro and starting up his own label. The house of Ungaro announced that the new ready-to-wear designer would be Vincent Darre. Vincent was born in France in 1961 and has worked with Prada, Chloe and Fendi. Since 2002 he was chief designer at Moschino. The house of Ungaro was owned by the Italian house of Salvatore Ferragamo. However in November 2005, Ferragamo sold Ungaro to a USA California-based venture capitalist Asim Abdullah who made his fortune in computer software and e-commerce. The sale includes garments, mens and womens fragrances and accessories. After the announcement, Emanuel Ungaro announced his retirement from designing. He has not been actively involved with the designing for the last six months apparently. Plans for the designer at present there, Vincent Darre, have not been discussed.

The name of the company is made up by the two founders, the fashion designer Herman (now Ermanno) Daelli and entrepreneur Toni Scervino, both from Florence. First the name of the company was Herman & Scervino and was simplified to Ermanno Scervino. The first collection was made under the name Ermanno Scervino in 1998 and gets a great success. In the following years they offered large collections, until in 2000 Ermanno Scervino became a brand itself. In just a few years it has established itself successfully on the international scenario thanks to products that interpret the Made-in-Italy craft tradition in an original, contemporary way. The womanï¿½s line was launched in 1999 and made its Milan catwalk debut in 2003 with the AW 2003/04 collection. Offering apparel and accessories, the range was immediately very popular with buyers and the press worldwide. The menswear range was launched in 2002 and made its catwalk debut as guest of honour at Pitti Immagine Uomo, in January 2005. The line showed again at the Pitti 2007 womenï¿½s preview for the inauguration of the new premises. In 2008 it made its Milano Moda Uomo debut with the SS 09 collection. Manufacturing of the junior collection began under license in 2005 but in 2007 the brand decided to manage both production and distribution. The range soon made a real impact on Italian and overseas distribution. The line shows every season at Pitti Immagine Bimbo. Ermanno Scervino Underwear made its debut in the AW 08/09 collection and was followed in SS 09 by the Beachwear range. ViaMazzini, an established licensee attuned to the Scervino style mission, manufactures these products to high standards and undertakes distribution. The Ermanno Scervino Eyewear collection of sunglasses and frames was presented at MIDO, in May 2008. The range is made and distributed under licence by Moa Ottica, an excellent cutting-edge Italian company specializing in eyewear manufacturing. The headquarters in Grassina, in the hills around Florence, were inaugurated in 2007. This is home to the design offices and the workshops that produce samples that were acquired by the company in the Florence district. The companyï¿½s administration and sales departments are also located in the new headquarters, alongside production logistics and distribution for the whole group, driving the manufacturing side, increasing the offer, but keeping alive the brandï¿½s inherent values. This industrialization process respects and reinforces corporate identity: designer talent, research, craft quality and Made-in-Italy. The new Milan showroom was inaugurated in 2008. The 1200-sq.m. open space in Via Manzoni, in the heart of the fashion district, was conceived as a container ready to change look thanks to displays and partitions that will adapt to changing trends and collections. Ermanno Scervino opens its frst boutique in Spain to showcase the women and men's collections. The 140 square-metre boutique is located in Madrid, Calle Serrano 82. The new opening plan will continue in Europe with Paris, where the company has already started working on the new fagship store located in Rue du Fabourg Saint-Honorï¿½: two foors for 200 square metres at number 18 of the prestigious shopping street. The opening is scheduled for December 2010. In Florence has been recently inaugurated a new corner inside the 'Four Seasons Hotel'. The new corner, focused on accessories, reinforces the brand's presence in the city together with the boutique in Piazza Antinori. The retail growth strategy continues in Asia, with two openings in 2010: a new corner in the department store Matsusaka in Japan and one in Shinsegae Main in Seoul, Korea. In 2010 the company has more than 500 multibrand outlets alongside 35 brands, located in Europe, Korea, Russia and Japan, including 7 direct and the rest is franchised.",['https://www.twitter.com/ermannoscervino'],"['Spring/Summer 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2021', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Pre-Fall 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2008', 'Autumn/Winter 2007', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2005']",['Ermanno Daelli'],1997.0,Herman Daelli

This universe of elegance derives from Gimmo Etro's innate passion for travel and history, which has now become the leitmotif of all the lines of the fashion maison. The establishment of Etro S.p.A. in 1968 therefore derives from Gimmo's profound love of culture and beauty. In the beginning, his company produced superb fabrics made of fine original fibers, decorated with elegant designs and dyed in chic colors. The Paisley motif first appeared in the Etro collections back in 1981. It was not only a masterpiece of the production, but it also became a symbol of the Etro brand, and would remain so for years to come. The fashion fabrics line was soon joined by the men's and women's accessory collections that always expressed ideas through fine materials and original decorations. The next step was a new leather goods line. The paisley jacquard fabric treated with a special plasticization technique became a status symbol of the chic Eighties. The home and the accessories that make it an elegant ambiance were the next objectives in Etro's creative and production development. The home accessories line dressed homes with incomparable, striking style. The Nineties marked Etro's debut in the prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter fashion world. Style and research focused on men's and women's collections, revealing extraordinary craftsmanship combined with an original, creative choice in materials and tailoring solutions.

Fendi,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/fendi/,Rome,Italy,https://www.fendi.it,['Adele Casagrande'],LVHM,"Fendi is an Italian fashion house best known for its ""baguette"" handbags. It started in 1918 as a fur and leather shop in Rome, but today is a multinational luxury goods brand owned by LVMH. Karl Lagerfeld is the creative director. Fendi began in 1918 when Adele Casagrande opened a leather and fur shop in Via del Plebiscito in central Rome. When Adele married Edoardo Fendi in 1925, they made a decision to change the name to Fendi. The business prospered, and a new shop was opened in Via Piave in 1932. By 1946 Paola, 15, the eldest of the couple's five daughters, went to work for the firm, followed by her sisters Carla, Anna, Franca, and Alda. In time each of the daughters would inherit 20% of the company.[1] In 1962 the Fendis signed up German designer Karl Lagerfeld.[1] Lagerfeld immediately created the inverted FF logo that joined the growing list of international status symbols, and then set about, aided and abetted by the sisters, to revolutionize the treatment of fur and other clothing. Marvin Traub, president of Bloomingdale's, discovered Fendi's leather goods and introduced them to the United States. Other outlets soon followed, and today Fendi is largely represented through high-end department stores. In 1969 Fendi presented its first ready-to-wear fur collection at Palazzo Pitti in Florence, bringing continuously evolving techniques and imaginative designs to lower-priced furs without sacrificing quality. When the sisters could not find the fabric clothes they wanted to show under the furs their ready-to-wear line was born, again to great success. In 1999 the sisters sold out to LVMH and Prada for an estimated US$850m[1], trumping a bid from Gucci of a rumoured US$700m. LVMH have since bought out Prada and are investing heavily in the brand, expanding the network of boutiques to 117 as of 2005. On October 19, 2007, the world was blown away with Fendi's fashion show on the Great Wall. Showcasing Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini's latest fashions and specially designed outfits for the Great Wall event, 88 models from Asia and across the world descended down a catwalk of more than 85 meters and showcased eastern and western looks from Fendiï¿½s Spring / Summer '08 collection to more than 500 guests, media and VIPS ï¿½ including Thandie Newton, Kate Bosworth and Zhang Ziyi.",['https://www.facebook.com/Fendi'],"['Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Resort 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Pre-Fall 2022', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Spring/Summer 2021', 'Autumn/Winter 2021', 'Autumn/Winter 2021', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Spring/Summer 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Resort 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Resort 2014', 'Resort 2014', 'Pre-Fall 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Pre-Fall 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Resort 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Pre-Fall 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2008', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Autumn/Winter 2007', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Spring/Summer 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2005', 'Spring/Summer 2005', 'Autumn/Winter 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2002', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2000', 'Spring/Summer 1998', 'Autumn/Winter 1998', 'Spring/Summer 1997', 'Autumn/Winter 1996', 'Spring/Summer 1996', 'Autumn/Winter 1995', 'Autumn/Winter 1993', 'Spring/Summer 1993', 'Autumn/Winter 1992', 'Spring/Summer 1991']","['Karl Otto Lagerfeld', 'Adele Casagrande']",1918.0,Adele Casagrande

Filippa K was founded in 1993, when Filippa Knutsson and her partner, Patrik Kihlborg, sought to bring sophistication and simplicity to contemporary fashion. Karin Segerblom who previously worked as a designer at Gul&Blï¿½ also joined the company at an early stage. The first collection of womenï¿½s jerseys, knits and jeans was launched through selected retailers in Sweden.

Today, years later, Filippa K has developed from a ï¿½kitchen tableï¿½ project into one of Scandinaviaï¿½s fastest growing clothing companies, with a yearly turnover of SEK 450 million (EUR 45 million). In 1997 they opened the first two Filippa K stores ï¿½ one in Stockholm and one in Oslo. One year later the Filippa K Man collection was launched and they open the third store, in Copenhagen. Since 2001 the European expansion continued with agency representation in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as the opening of a Filippa K store in Amsterdam. Furthermore they opened up a showroom in Brussels and entered the German, Swiss and Irish markets during 2002. In 2003 the distribution was secured in Canada and the United States.

Givenchy,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/givenchy/,Paris,France,https://www.givenchy.fr,['Hubert de Givenchy'],,"Givenchy is a French brand of clothing, accessories, perfumes and cosmetics with les Parfums Givenchy. It was founded in 1952 by designer Hubert de Givenchy, who retired in 1995. John Galliano succeeded him as designer, but he was later replaced by Alexander McQueen. In 2001, designer Julien McDonald was appointed Artistic Director for the women's lines, while in 2003 Ozwald Boateng was appointed the designer for the men's range. Clothing lines include haute couture as well as ready-to-wear men's and women's fashions. The reins for both haute couture and women's ready-to-wear were ultimately passed on to Riccardo Tisci in 2005 when he was named chief designer of womenswear. Tisci's apparent fascination with gothic touches (dark, languid dresses on sickly-looking models for fall couture) and space-age minimalism (one ready-to-wear show featured white-clad models drifting aimlessly around a sterile-white sphere) have drawn new attention to the brand. Reviews and output so far have been mixed and inconsistent, but many, including influential fashion critics (such as Cathy Horyn of the New York Times and Suzy Menkes of the International Herald Tribune) have homed in on Tisci's conceptual leanings, as well as his future potential for revitalizing the Givenchy brand and infusing it with his precision and imagination.

Gucci,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/gucci/,Florence,Italy,https://www.gucci.com,['Guccio Gucci'],Gucci Group,"The House of Gucci, better known as simply Gucci, is an Italian iconic fashion and leather goods label. It was founded by Guccio Gucci (b.1881 - d.1953) in Florence in 1906. Gucci is considered one of the most famous, prestigious, and easily recognizable fashion brands in the world. Gucci generated over US$7 billion worldwide of revenue in 2006 according to BusinessWeek magazine and was ranked 46th in the magazine's annual chart ""Top 100 Brands"". For this reason Gucci is the second biggest selling fashion brand after LVMH. Most importantly Gucci is the biggest selling Italian brand in the world. The House of Gucci belongs to the French conglomerate company Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR). Gucci operates about 425 stores worldwide and it wholesales its products through franchisees and upscale department stores. In 1921, Guccio Gucci opens a leather goods company and small luggage store in his native Florence. Having spent years working in London's Savoy Hotel, he had absorbed the refined aesthetic of English nobility, and introduces this sensibility in Italy through exclusive leather goods created and produced by the master craftsmanship of Tuscan artisans. In 1938, Gucci expanded and a boutique was opened in Rome. Guccio was responsible for designing many of the company's most notable products. In 1947, Gucci introduced the ""Bamboo Bag"", which become one of the first of Gucci's iconic products. During the 1950s, the trademark green-red-green web, which is derived from the saddle girth, becomes a great success and remains one of the most familiar identifiers of the brand. With stores opening in Milan and New York, Gucci starts to build a global presence as a symbol of modern luxury. Guccio Gucci dies in 1953. His sons Aldo, Vasco, Ugo and Rodolfo take over the business. After Guccio's death, Aldo helped lead the company to a position of international prominence, opening the companyï¿½s first boutiques in London, Paris, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills. Even in Gucciï¿½s fledgling years, the family was notorious for its ferocious infighting. Disputes regarding inheritances, stock holdings, and day-to-day operations of the stores often divided the family and led to alliances. Gucci expanded overseas, board meetings about the companyï¿½s future often ended with tempers flaring and luggage and purses flying. Gucci targeted the Far East for further expansion in the late 1960s, opening stores in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Korea. At that time, the company adopts the legendary interlocking double 'G' logo, the Flora silk scarf (worn by Grace Kelly), and the Jackie O shoulder bag, made famous by Jackie Kennedy, the wife of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Gucci remained one of the premier luxury goods establishments in the world until the late 1970s, when a series of disastrous business decisions and family quarrels brought the company to the verge of bankruptcy. At the time, brothers Aldo and Rodolfo controlled equal 50% shares of the company, though contributed less to the company than he and his sons did. In 1979, Aldo developed the Gucci Accessories Collection, or GAC, intended to bolster the sales for the Gucci Parfums sector, which his sons controlled. GAC consisted of small accessories, such as cosmetic bags, lighters, and pens, which were priced at considerably lower points than the other items in the companyï¿½s accessories catalogue. Aldo relegated control of Parfums to his son Roberto in an effort to weaken Rodolfoï¿½s control of the overall operations of the company. Aldo Gucci expanded into new markets including an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC). The 1972 AMC Hornet compact ""Sportabout"" station wagon became one of the first American cars to offer a special luxury trim package created by a famous fashion designer. Though the Gucci Accessories Collection was well received, it proved to be the force that brought the Gucci dynasty crashing down. Within a few years, the Parfums division began outselling the Accessories division. The newly-founded wholesaling business had brought the once-exclusive brand to over a thousand stores in the United States alone with the GAC line, deteriorating the brandï¿½s standing with fashionable customers. It did not take long before ravaged the companyï¿½s pomp by flooding the market with cheap knockoffs, further tarnishing the Gucci name. Meanwhile, infighting was taking its toll on the operations of the company back in Italy: Rodolfo and Aldo squabbled over the Parfums division, of which Rodolfo controlled a meager 20% stake. By the mid-1980s, when Aldo was convicted of tax evasion in the United States by the testimony of his own son, the outrageous headlines of gossip magazines generated as much publicity for Gucci as its designs. Rodolfoï¿½s death in 1983 caused a major shakeup in the company when he left his 50% stake in Gucci to his son, Maurizio Gucci. Maurizio allied with Aldoï¿½s son Paolo to gain control of the Board of Directors and established the Gucci Licensing division in the Netherlands for purposes. Following the decision, the rest of the family left the company and, for the first time in years, one man was at the helm of Gucci. Maurizio sought to bury the fighting that had torn the company and his family apart and turned to talent outside of the company for Gucciï¿½s future. A turnaround of the company devised in the late 1980s made Gucci one of the world's most influential fashion houses and a highly profitable business operation. In October of 1995 Gucci went public and had its first initial public offering on the AEX and NYSE for $22 per share. November of 1997 also proved to be a successful year as Gucci acquired a watch licensee, Severin-Montres, and renamed it Gucci Timepieces. The Gucci brand is considered one of the most frequently mentioned brands in music. The firm was named ""European Company of the Year 1998"" by the European Business Press Federation for its economic and financial performance, strategic vision as well as management quality. Gucci world offices and headquarters are in Milan, Paris, London, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Beverly Hills, Honolulu, Tokyo, and Shanghai. In 1989, Maurizio managed to persuade Dawn Mello, whose revival of New York's Bergdorf Goodman in the 1970s made her a star in the retail business, to join the newly formed Gucci Group as creative director. At the helm of Gucci America was Domenico De Sole, a former lawyer who helped oversee Maurizioï¿½s takeover of ten 1987 and 1989. The last addition to the creative team, which already included designers from Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein, was a young designer named Tom Ford. Dawn Mello hired Ford in 1990 at the urging of his partner, writer and editor Richard Buckley. In the early 1990s, Gucci underwent what is now recognized as the poorest time in the company's history. Maurizio riled distributors, Investcorp shareholders, and executives at Gucci America by drastically reining in on the sales of the Gucci Accessories Collection, which in the United States alone generated $110 million in revenue every year. The companyï¿½s new accessories failed to pick up the slack, and for the next three years the company experienced heavy losses and teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. Maurizio was a charming man who passionately loved his family's business, but after four years most of the company's senior managers agreed that he was incapable of running the company. His management had had an adverse effect on the desirability of the brand, product quality, and distribution control. He was forced to sell his shares in the company to Investcorp in August of 1993. Dawn Mello returned to her job at Bergdorf Goodman less than a year after Maurizioï¿½s departure, and the position of creative director went to Tom Ford, then just 32 years old. Ford had worked for years under the uninspiring direction of Maurizio and Mellow and wanted to take the companyï¿½s image in a new direction. De Sole, who had been elevated to CEO, realized that if Gucci was to become a profitable company, it would require a new image, and so he agreed to pursue Fordï¿½s vision. Domenico De Sole was incensed by the news and declined Arnaultï¿½s request for a spot on the board of directors, where he would have access to Gucciï¿½s confidential earnings reports, strategy meetings, and design concepts. De Sole reacted by issuing new shares of stock in an effort to dilute the value of Arnaultï¿½s holdings. He also approached French holding company Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) about the possibility of forming a strategic alliance. Francois Pinault, the companyï¿½s founder, agreed to the idea and purchased 37 million shares in the company, or a 40% stake. Arnaultï¿½s share was diluted to a paltry 20%, and a legal battle ensued to challenge the legitimacy of the new Gucci-PPR partnership, with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom representing Gucci. Courts in the Netherlands ultimately upheld the PPR deal, as it did not violate that country's business laws. PPR now owns 68% of the group. The second largest shareholder is Crï¿½dit Lyonnais with 11%. As of September 2001 a settlement agreement was put into place between Gucci Group, LVMH, and PPR. 2001 was also an incredible year for the Gucci Group as it acquired percentages of Bottega Venetta, Di Modolo, Balenciaga, and formed a partnership with Stella McCartney. In the 2004, the company, with its record high sales, went up for sale. The asking price was ï¿½7.2 Billion. Three very important people in the fashion industry decided to form three individual groups to take a dramatic impact on the fashion industry. They were Barry Dhillon, Pam Dhillon, and Rebecka John. Barry Dhillon was a highly respected person who was a catwalk specificationist and perfectionist in all of his directing and fashion roles he fulfilled with a team of 5,000 staff per team. Pam Dhillon with her organisation, and operation solo fire which put her high team of 10,000 staff to investigate further into other fashion teams and units, highly trained fashion surveillance. Rebecka John who worked closly with Barry and Pam with her staff of 4,000 people. The teams became one. After a failed attempt at contract renewal with PPR in 2003, Tom Ford and Domenico de Sole decided to take their leave from Gucci Group. Fordï¿½s last show for Gucci returned to the roots of his first successful collection: the culture of celebrity. Print advertisements featured models in sleek, simple gowns inspired by the glamour of 1920s silent film stars. Ford priced up the ready-to-wear and used exotic fabrics like alligator and boar hide. His collection for Yves Saint Laurent followed the lead of the previous seasonï¿½s Gucci womenï¿½s wear, with form fitting kimonos and Asian patterned dresses, while the menswear collection featured classic-looking tuxedos and smoking jackets. The announcement of his departure led to a complete presale of many items in New York department stores, and waitlists for his last accessories formed just days after the collection showed in Milan. In 2005, Tom Ford began designing a line of cosmetics for Estee Lauder, and planned to launch his own line of ready-to-wear and accessories under a Tom Ford label. Following Ford's departure, Gucci Group retained three designers to continue the success of the company's flagship label: Alessandra Facchinetti and Frida Giannini, all of whom had worked under Ford's creative direction. Facchinetti was elevated to Creative Director of Womenswear in 2004 and designed for two seasons before leaving the company after a management dispute. Ray served as Creative Director of Menswear for three years before resigning in January 2006, citing his inability to create a consistent image for Gucci during his time as head designer. 32-year-old Giannini, who had been responsible for designing men's and women's accessories, currently serves as Creative Director for the entire brand. Giannini's Spring 2006 collection was lauded for its color and energy, recreating the buzz around the company's ready-to-wear that was first heard after Ford's 1995 season. Giannini's collections have thereafter departed from Ford's erotic 1990s looks. Even her fall-winter 2006 collection, with its sky-high hemlines and revealing necklines ""wasn't quite Tom Ford's all-out orgy of glamour"", as a review on Vogue magazine's website stated.",['https://www.facebook.com/gucci'],"['Cruise 2025', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Resort 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Resort 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Resort 2022', 'Pre-Fall 2022', 'Resort 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Cruise 2019', 'Resort 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Resort 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Resort 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Pre-Fall 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Pre-Fall 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Pre-Fall 2013', 'Resort 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Resort 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Resort 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Resort 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2008', 'Cruise 2008', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Autumn/Winter 2007', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Cruise 2007', 'Spring/Summer 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Spring/Summer 2006', 'Winter 2006', 'Spring/Summer 2005', 'Autumn/Winter 2005', 'Autumn/Winter 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2003', 'Spring/Summer 2002', 'Autumn/Winter 2002', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2000', 'Spring/Summer 1999', 'Autumn/Winter 1998', 'Spring/Summer 1998', 'Autumn/Winter 1998', 'Spring/Summer 1997', 'Autumn/Winter 1996', 'Spring/Summer 1996', 'Spring/Summer 1995', 'Autumn/Winter 1995', 'Autumn/Winter 1994', 'Autumn/Winter 1993', 'Spring/Summer 1993', 'Autumn/Winter 1992']","['Guccio Gucci', 'Frida Giannini', 'Yvan Mispelaere', 'Alessandra Facchinetti']",1881.0,Guccio Gucci

Halston,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/halston/,New York,USA,https://www.halston.com,['Roy Halston Frowick'],Neema Clothing Ltd,"After rising in the fashion world in the sixties as a milliner for Bergdorf Goodman (and, famously, Jacqueline Kennedy), Roy Halston Frowick launched his eponymous womenswear label in 1968, buoyed by his connections with socialites and celebrities. Halston expanded to include menswear and perfume in 1975. In 1973, Norton Simon incorporated Halston's business for $ 12 million and named this new division of its conglomerate Halston Enterprises Inc. In 1983, Halston signed with J.C. Penney, the large department store, for a cheaper line, which caused many of his higher class clientele to leave him. Despite his achievements, his increasing drug use and failure to meet deadlines (he was reluctant to hire junior designers to design licensed products) undermined his success. In October of 1984 he was fired from his own company and lost the right to design and sell clothes under his own name. In 1990, he died, when only 58 years old, of lung cancer from complications of AIDS in San Francisco, California. As ""the first designer to realize the potential of licensing himself,"" his influence went beyond style to reshape the business of fashion. Through his licensing agreement with JC Penney, his designs were accessible to women at a variety of income levels. Although this practice is not uncommon today, it was a controversial move at the time Halston, his perfume, was sold in a bottle designed by Elsa Peretti and was the second biggest selling perfume of all time. New fragrances bearing the Halston name were introduced in 1994 and 1995, but the name and its legacy languished until the company was dismantled in 1996. French Fragrances Inc. bought the Halston scents; Tropic Tex Apparel bought the remainder of the Halston's products. To support the reintroduction of the Halston brand and image, Tropic Tex launched a major advertising campaign and brought Randolph Duke on board as creative director. Over the next few years, the Halston name was licensed for beds and linens, scarves, belts, handbags, hosiery, sunglasses, jewelry, timepieces, leather apparel, sleepwear, and foundations. In the capable hands of Duke, Halston Signature womenswear regained much of its cachetï¿½trunk shows at Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue sold over $200,000-worth of couture in a few days in 1997. A menswear launch, however, was not as successful and the overexposure in licensing caught up with Tropic Tex. After experiencing financial difficulties, Tropic Tex agreed to sell Halston International to the Connecticut-based Catterton Group in April 1998. Halston's new owners fired Duke and hired Kevan Hall, who had worked there briefly earlier in the year and abruptly left. Yet by 1999 Catterton had sold Halston's assets to Neema Clothing Ltd., which then hired Craig Natiello as design director. A new Halston Signature menswear line debuted in 2001 after a series of delays, and Natiello had settled in with his womenswear designs. Thai-born Piyawat joined Halston in April 2001. When Craig Natiello left, he took over the design for Halston. He presented a successful Fall/Winter 2002 collection, followed by another for Spring/Summer 2003. Bradley Bayou joined Halston in December 2002 and has created the collections for Fall 2003 and for Spring/Summer 2004 which was shown during New York Fashion Week in September 2003. It was revived in fall 2008 by Harvey Weinstein, Jimmy Chooï¿½s Tamara Mellon, and stylist Rachel Zoe. The owners installed former Versace designer Marco Zanini as creative chief, who showed his first collection in February 2008. Net-a-Porter signed on to sell pieces immediately following the show. But Zanini was dismissed in July 2008, amid rumors of disagreements among the creative board about the direction of the line. No successor has been named; the subsequent spring 2009 collection was presented at the Museum of Modern Art and created by an unnamed design team.",['https://www.instagram.com/halston.blake'],"['Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Spring/Summer 1998', 'Autumn/Winter 1998']","['Bradley Bayou', 'Roy Halston Frowick', 'Kevan Hall']",1968.0,Roy Halston Frowick

Helmut Lang,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/helmut-lang/,New York,USA,https://www.helmutlang.com,['Helmut Lang'],Link Theory Holdings,"His clothes were fairly successful in his native Austria, and, after a fair exhibition of his clothes at the Centre Pompidou in Paris initated by the Austrian government, he branched out successfully to Paris in 1986 and created the label 'Helmut Lang'. And yet, after communting back and forth between France and Austria, he eventually withdrew from Paris and returned to Vienna in the late 1980s. At this time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, minimalist fashion was at its height, with Jil Sander, Giorgio Armani and Helmut Lang himself being very popular and successful. Lang moved to New York in 1997 and subsequently set up his company's headquarters in 142 Greene St. in SoHo in 1998. Helmut Lang used to make both a women's and men's line, but kept his collection under a single name and presented both lines in one show. He also introduced an underwear (1995) and jeans (1996) line as well as accessories, such as footwear (1990) and and fragrances (1999), but otherwise preferred to keep the brand unified to solidify its identity and strength. The runway show venues for the Helmut Lang label were switched from Paris (until 1998) to New York and back again to Paris by Prada (from 2002 to 2005). The collections/presentations used to be called 'séances de travail' (French for 'working sessions') by Mr. Lang. In 1999 Lang entered into collaboration with Prada to open boutiques all over Europe and expand his line. He is now poised to become a major global marketing force, with a Jeans line, a perfume deal with Proctor and Gamble and a leather license in the pipeline. Prada had acquired 51% of Helmut Lang's company in August 1999.  Despite the quality of the clothes and the slight revival of minimalist fashion in the early 2000s, the Helmut Lang brand did not fare well. Prada decided to cancel the Helmut Lang Jeans license, which had been responsible for more than half of the brand's sales, and intended to develop an in-house accessories line. But neither the new accessories nor the fragrances proved a large success. Mr. Lang is said to have insisted that one of his colognes be produced when a test study by the manufacturer-to-be, Procter & Gamble, strongly suggested to modify the scent. After alleged disputes with Prada Group's CEO Patrizio Bertelli on how the brand should be continued and after Mr. Lang had sold his remaining shares to Prada in October. In September 2004, they took complete control by buying out the remaining 49%. It was announced that Helmut will continue as creative director of the company designing the clothes. Financial details were not disclosed. In a surprise announcement in January 2005, the Prada Group who own Helmet Lang's company, informed of his departure from his own company. He has been considered a by-word for cool in recent years, and it appears his ideas for running his company were at odds with the Prada management just as Jil Sander's were when she left her own company recently. In March Prada announced that they would close the Helmut Lang showroom in New York. However Helmut is not yet down. He is talking to several major companies about the future. After Mr. Lang's departure, Prada unsuccessfully tried to continue the collections with an in-house design team. In March 2005, Prada closed down the label's headquarters in SoHo, New York. In September 2005, Prada announced that production of the lines had been halted. By the end of 2005, all that existed of the brand was its name: the design atelier had been closed, the collections had been discontinued and all of the art-inspired Helmut Lang stores had been shut down (with the exception of the Paris location, to sell remaining stock). The corporate web site, which formerly displayed pictures of the collections, remained online, but the contents could no longer be seen. On March 17, 2006, Prada Group announced that, after six loss-making years, Link Theory Holdings (LTH) of Tokyo would be acquiring the Helmut Lang brand for an estimated €20 million. This came about three weeks after Prada had sold the Jil Sander label to British equity firm Change Capital Partners (CCP). Already in spring 2005, it had been rumored that Prada was trying to sell the label. Prada Group was said to want to concentrate on its core labels, Prada and Miu Miu, again. The Japanese holding company LTH, developer of the theory fashion label in Japan and the US, was said re-launched the Helmut Lang collections under the direction of a ""suitable"" designer for the spring/summer 2007 season (presented in fall 2006), in select boutiques worldwide as a “contemporary brand"". The new label was said to be based out of New York City. LTH also owns profitable German fashion house Rosner, which it bought in late October 2005, as well as the Joie, PLS+T and Kulson labels. Rumor had it for a while that Russian-born designer Alexandre Plokhov of menswear label Cloak, a former men's pattern maker for fashion house Marc Jacobs, and winner of the 2005 Swarovski's Perry Ellis Award for Emerging Talent Menswear, might be the new designer for Helmut Lang. It was never, though, expected that Mr. Lang himself would return to the label that bears his name, although Chikara Sasake, president and chief executive of Link-Theory Holdings Company, gave to understand that if Lang “wants to come back, the door is always open”. In May 2006, it was announced that Michael and Nicole Colovos, an American-New Zealand designer couple, who formerly had their own Los Angeles-based denim label Habitual, had been installed by Link Theory as creative directors for the new Helmut Lang brand. From February 2007, select upscale retailers such as Barneys or Bergdorf Goodman carry the spring/summer 2007 Helmut Lang contemporary sportswear collection. The design office has been set up in West Chelsea in New York. The collection, described as ""a commercial reduction of [Mr. Lang's] fashion identity"", has received quite favorable reviews even though it is clearly not seen as a continuation of the original line. The item prices in the collection are about 20% above those for comparable Link Theory items and, hence, below the original Helmut Lang prices. Link Theory expects to generate US$ 8 million in revenues in 2008 and make a profit in 2009 with the label. The company also announced that ""over the long term"" they intend ""to also establish exclusive Helmut Lang shops"" in the US, Europe and Japan. The Helmut Lang web site was re-activated at the end of 2006 and was fully launched in spring 2007. Mr. Lang, who resides on Long Island of independent means, is said not to be involved in the re-launch in any way. In March 2007, Link Theory opened the first post-Prada signature Helmut Lang store in Tokyo's fashionable Aoyama district. In Japan, the company has since then installed several Helmut Lang stores-in-store at local department stores. In August 2007, a new freestanding Helmut Lang store was opened on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. It is, after the Tokyo store, the second signature Helmut Lang store since the closing of the last original store in Paris. The store, in close proximity to Melrose Place, is adjacent to an existing theory store at 8424 Melrose Avenue. Another Helmut Lang store opened on September 28, 2007 on Maiden Lane in San Francisco, in the building previously occupied by Jil Sander. In New York City, a temporary 'pop-up shop' opened in mid-December 2007, while the company is apparently looking for a larger location in the Meatpacking District.",['https://www.facebook.com/HELMUTLANG.FB'],"['Spring/Summer 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Resort 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Resort 2013', 'Pre-Fall 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Pre-Fall 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Resort 2012', 'Pre-Fall 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2005', 'Spring/Summer 2004', 'Autumn/Winter 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2002', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Autumn/Winter 2000', 'Spring/Summer 2000', 'Spring/Summer 1997', 'Autumn/Winter 1997', 'Spring/Summer 1996', 'Autumn/Winter 1995', 'Autumn/Winter 1994', 'Autumn/Winter 1991']",['Helmut Lang'],1986.0,Helmut Lang

It is part of the Italian Gilmar group. 1974 Fashion hailed novelty and immediately yielded to it when Giuliana Marchini launched the project ICEBERG, the first range ever to propose the idea of fashionable sportswear. This knitwear project broke away from the patterns of the time. They started with menï¿½s wear. Knitwear revealed its many facets, it could even became a coat, with unusual colours, new manufacturing techniques, new material and Andy Warholï¿½s Pop Art on knitted garments. In 1976 ICEBERG launched its first collection for women. ICEBERG strengthened its distribution in Japan by signing an important collaboration agreement with the Japanese multinational Toyota in 1987. Two years later ICEBERG inaugurated its first boutique in Milan, in No. 10, via Montenapoleone and opened a new showroom in No. 21, via S. Andrea. In 1991 ICEBERG opened a new showroom in New York. In 1992 the new leatherwear line was conceived, entirely self-produced and the first of a wide range of accessories signed ICEBERG. The creation of ICEBERG Jeans for men and women was marked in 1995, today called ICE JEANS ICEBERG. ICEBERGï¿½s first fashion show Autumn/Winter 1995-96 Collection for women was held in Milan. Furthermore in this year the first ICEBERG eyewear collection was launched in the market. ICEBERGï¿½s first fashion show Spring/Summer 1998 Collection for men was held. In 2000 Paolo Gerani was appointed creative director of ICEBERG. A new license agreement ï¿½ the new collection ICEBERG for children was launched from autumn/winter 2003/04. Initially they made knitwear and then branched out into garments. The Gilmar Groupï¿½s founders are Giuliana Marchini, the creative person in the family, and her husband Silvano Gerani, the manager. Their winning decisions and enthusiasm have given the former small knitwear manufacturing firm the size and importance it enjoys today. Giulianan Marchini was the only woman to be knighted for ï¿½services to industryï¿½ by the President of the Italian Republic in 1994. She was the 14th woman ever to receive the honour in the history of the Republic. Silvano Gerani, the Groupï¿½s chairman, is the companyï¿½s organizational mind. His great pride is the establishment in San Giovanni in Margnano, along with the satisfaction of a company continuously growing over forth years. Paolo Gernai is the Gilmar Groupï¿½s deputy-chairman but he is also the creative director of Iceberg, the companyï¿½s leading designer label.

Marni has recently risen to prominence as women have turned away from overtly sexy clothing to designs emphasizing color, print, and shape. The fashion line was started in 1994, when Castiglioni's became known for her contributions to the design of fur. At that moment, fur was at its most unpopular and typically designed in an old-fashioned manner, but Castiglioni instead treated it as a normal fabric to make modern, wearable clothing. Her fashion line, which is named after her sister Marni, grew as her customers needed something to wear under or with their fur. Today, the company produces a full array of ready-to-wear clothing, handbags, jewelry, and eyewear.[] Marni has recently changed from ""a well-kept secret among like-minded aesthetes to a label followed for its own sake."" Jenna Lyons, senior vice president of women's design for J.Crew, attributes Marni's rise to the ""post-Tom Ford era,"" saying that women are lately being bold through color, print, and shape rather than through overt sex appeal and are dressing more for other women than for men. For Fall 2007, Marni produced its first line of men's clothing and caused a minor splash by including leggings as standalone bottoms for men. Marni sells clothing in sixteen countries worldwide; boutiques locations include New York City, Los Angeles, Beijing, Shanghai, Sydney, Moscow, and Tokyo. Online sales began in 2006. Marni ""prides itself on its Italian heritage""--its entire line is made in Italy--and does not have any licensees. Castiglioni's husband, Gianni, is Marni's CEO, and the company's annual sales are approximately $100 million. With these figures and the label's increasing cachet, fashion insiders have said that Marni--a family-owned label--is ""just the type of label luxury-goods conglomerates and private-equity funds are looking to snap up.""

With critically acclaimed, award winning collections, and a loyal following of hollywood's top celebrities, this fashion powerhouse has evolved into one of the hottest names in the fashion industry today. continuously expanding while defining trends, Max Azria has let the industry know that he is indeed building a global empire. Named for the French phrase bon chic, bon genre, a Parisian slang meaning: good style, good attitude, the company is a true combination of European sophistication and American spirit. Since its inception in 1989, BCBG Max Azria has been known for its signature collection of women's apparel from Fashion Designer Max Azria. Gradually expanding his company, Azria has successfully developed other high-fashion collections for women. From separates, suiting, evening dresses, and denim, to footwear, eyewear, swimwear, and handbags, BCBG Max Azria has become a lifestyle collection that takes today's modern women from day to night, work to weekend. With the introduction of a new plus size line in Fall, 1999, Azria not only expanded his product offering, but also his customer base, catering to a much wider range of women. BCBG Max Azria has also addressed the men's arena offering the company's signature spin on everything from casual looks to suiting to outerwear, and for Spring 1999 will launch a new collection of men's footwear that will work back with the ready-to-wear collection. One of the keys to BCBG Max Azria's success has been Azria's ability to mix his creative eye with his very keen business sense. As one of today's rare breed of designer-businessmen, Azria used his remarkable intellect to create a new platform in the industry. With the launch of BCBG Max Azria, Azria accomplished a feat that no other designer has been able to achieve: he redefined the designer category by offering a high end designer collection at contemporary price points. Previewing the collection on the runway for the first time during new York city's fashion week earned BCBG Max Azria outstanding reviews, and status as a premier American designer. Continuously showing the collection on the runway each season has awarded Azria a consistently packed house of top celebrities and editors, and rave reviews from the most distinguished publications. Adding to its list of successes, BCBG Max Azria has become a retail giant, with over 75 freestanding BCBG Max Azria retail boutiques throughout north America, which serve as consummate showcases for the women's collections. On an international level, BCBG Max Azria opened its first three European based boutiques in 1999, which are located in the most significant shopping districts in Paris. Additional international BCBG Max Azria boutiques are located in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, and Venezuela, among other countries. The retail phenomenon is completed with the collections also being sold in specialty stores throughout North America as well as in in-store shops in major department stores including Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Dillard's, and the London based Selfridges. Perpetually pushing the edge of the envelope in business acumen, in 1996 Azria diversified his product categories, and became immersed in the contemporary and junior businesses as well. In addition to the collections under the BCBG Max Azria label, Azria also owns and oversees two additional labels: to the Max, an edgy junior sportswear line; and parallel, a directional women's contemporary line. Creating an even broader portfolio of diversified yet complimentary product categories, and marking yet another leap towards fulfilling his lifetime dream of running one of the largest and most versatile fashion houses in the world, Azria officially acquired the French couture design house, Herve Leger, in September, 1998. Herve Leger is a collection of beautiful yet seductive couture and deluxe ready-to-wear designs. Continuously applying his retail expertise to all aspects of the business, Azria has began developing a retail presence for the parallel and Herve Leger collections. The first parallel boutique was opened in October, 1997 on Robertson Boulevard in Beverly Hills, while the U.S. flagship Herve Leger boutique, which is the second boutique in the world, opened in March, 1999 in the centre of sunset plaza in Hollywood.

Like many Italian firms, Max Mara remains a family company although, interestingly, no member of the family is a fashion designer. Instead Max Mara operates by the highly successful formula of employing well-known fashion designers to create their collections. Designers who have created collections for Max Mara include Anne Marie Beretta, Karl Lagerfeld, Luciano Soprani, Guy Paulin, and Jean-Charles de Castelbajac. The identity of more recent Max Mara designers was a jealously-guarded secret; they were, however, acknowledged in retrospect. The first Max Mara shop was opened in Reggio Emilia in northern Italy in 1951 and the first collection consisted of two coats and a suit which were copies of Paris couture designs. By the dawn of the 21st century, the firm was certainly serving these needs, with 700 stores in 90 countries, most recently Russia, and a recent U.S. expansion which opened shops in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, Dallas, Boston, Beverly Hills, Houston, Miami, Palm Beach, San Francisco, and Seattle.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the firm popularized fashion trends such as the beatnik look, safari jackets for men and women, tight pants and tall, thigh-high boots, including the creation of arguably the most famous classic tuxedo suit for women in 1966, Le Smoking suit. He also started mainstreaming the idea of wearing silhouettes from the 1920s, '30s and '40s. Yves Saint Laurent was the first Couture house to launch, in 1966, the modern concept of luxury womenï¿½s prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter, in a collection called ï¿½Rive Gaucheï¿½. It was followed in 1969 by a ï¿½Rive Gauche menï¿½s ready-to-wear line. The Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche boutiques were soon opened throughout the world, allowing fashion-conscious working individuals to wear the Yves Saint Laurent designs. He was also the first designer to use black models in his runway shows. Among St. Laurent's muses were Loulou de La Falaise, the daughter of a French marquis and an Anglo-Irish fashion model, Betty Catroux, the half-Brazilian daughter of an American diplomat and wife of a French decorator, Talitha Pol-Getty, who died of drug overdose in 1971, and Catherine Deneuve, the iconic French actress. Ambassador to the couturier during the late 1970s and early 80s was London socialite millionairess Diane Boulting-Casserley Vandelli, making the brand ever more popular amongst the European jet-set and upper classes. In 1993, the Saint-Laurent fashion house was sold to the pharmaceuticals company Sanofi for approximately $600,000,000. In 1999, the Gucci Group (the luxury division of the PPR Group) bought the YSL brand and Tom Ford designed the ready-to-wear collection while Saint-Laurent designed the haute couture collection. The following year, dogged by years of poor health, drug abuse, depression, alcoholism, criticisms of YSL designs, Saint-Laurent closed the illustrious couture house of YSL. While the house no longer exists, the brand still survives through its parent company Gucci. The prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter line is still being produced under the management of Valï¿½rie Hermann, appointed CEO in 2005, and Stefano Pilati as Creative Director after Tom Ford retired in 2004. Since 2004, the brand has renewed the exceptional legacy of its founder while bringing a contemporary approach to its collections, which combine elegance, top-quality fabrics, refined and discreet but recognizable details. Today Yves Saint Laurentï¿½s collections include womenï¿½s and menï¿½s ready-to-wear, shoes, handbags, small leather goods, jewellery, scarves, ties and eyewear. They are designed for both modern women who have a keen sense of freedom and follow their instincts with assurance, captivating others with their elegance, as well as men who prefer a nonconformist look and assert the different facets of their personality in a modern and sensitive way. The Yves Saint Laurent network currently has 63 directly-operated stores, including flagship stores in Paris, New York, London, Milan, Hong Kong and Tokyo. The brand is also present in the most prestigious multi-brand boutiques and department stores in the world. It was followed in 1969 by a ï¿½Rive Gauche menï¿½s ready-to-wear line.

Vionnet,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/vionnet/,Milan,Italy,https://www.vionnet.com,['Madeleine Vionnet'],Mateo Marzotto,"The House of Vionnet opened in 1912 at 222, Rue de Rivoli. Madeleine Vionnet provided one-third of the financing while the remaining investment was supplied by one of her client, Germaine Lilas, Henri's Lillas' daughter, the owner of the Parisian department store Bazar de l'Hï¿½tel de Ville (BHV). In 1914, when World War I started, Madeleine Vionnet closed the house and set off to visit Rome. In 1919, the house reopened after the war. Mr. Martinez de Hoz, an Argentinian, joined Mr. Lillas as main shareholder of the house. During the same period, Thayaht, a futurist artist, created Vionnet's logo and started designing textiles, clothing and jewelry for the house. In 1922, Thï¿½ophile Bader, owner of the Galeries Lafayette, joined current shareholders Mr. de Hoz and Mr. Lillas in a new venture called Vionnet & Cie and became the majority shareholder. Few months later, on April 15, 1923, Vionnet's new premises opened at 50, Avenue Montaigne. The so-called ""Temple of Fashion"", a collaboration of architect Ferdinand Chanut, decorator George de Feure and crystal sculptor Renï¿½ Lalique, incorporated a spectacular Salon de Prï¿½sentation and two boutiques: a fur salon and a lingerie salon. 1923 was a very active year for the house: Vionnet co-founded the first anticopyist Association (Lï¿½Association pour la Dï¿½fense des Arts Plastiques et Appliquï¿½s), hosted in the Houseï¿½s premises and directed Vionnet & Cieï¿½s managing director; Vionnet introduced fingerprinted labels to authenticate models (each garment produced in Vionnet studios bears a label featuring Vionnetï¿½s original signing and an imprint of Vionnetï¿½s right thumb); Vionnet & Cie entered into a distribution arrangement with Charles and Ray Gutman, who own Charles & Ray Ladiesï¿½ Tailors and Importers in New York City. In November, the first collection of Vionnet clothing shown at Charles and Ray was an enormous success. In 1924, architect and designer Boris Lacroix was appointed art director of the House. From 1924 to 1937, he designed furniture, logos, printed textiles, handbags, accessories and took part in the planning of Vionnetï¿½s perfumes. In the mid-twenties, the house was extremely active in the USA. In 1924, Vionnet & Cie signed an exclusive production and distribution agreement with Fifth Avenue retail store Hickson Inc. In February 1924, the Vionnet New York Salon opened at Hickson and an exclusive collection of gowns was presented. In 1925, Vionnet & Cie was the first French couture house to open a subsidiary in New York: Madeleine Vionnet Inc., located at 661 Fifth Avenue. The salon sold ï¿½one-size-fits-allï¿½ designs with unfinished hems, to be adjusted to fit individual clients. Vionnet also produced ready-to-wear designs for US wholesale. Arguably the first prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter ever made from Paris haute couture, the garments bore a label signed by Madeleine Vionnet along with ï¿½Repeated Originalï¿½ as a trademark name. During this time, in France, Vionnet opened a salon in the Grand Casino at Biarritz. in 1925, the house launched its first limited edition perfume comprising four fragrances named alphabetically: ï¿½Aï¿½, ï¿½Bï¿½, ï¿½Cï¿½ and ï¿½Dï¿½. The geometrical bottle was designed by Boris Lacroix while the scent was made in collaboration with the House of Coty. In 1927, Vionnet opened a school within her couture house to teach apprentices how to create clothing on the bias cut. In 1929, Vionnet led the establishment of a new anticopyist association, the P.A.I.S., directed by Armand Trouyet, managing director of Vionnet & Cie. In 1932, the House acquired a new five-storey building at 50, Avenue Montaigne housing 21 workshops along with a clinic (equipped with both doctors and dentists) and a gymnasium. At this time, the house employed 1,200 seamstresses. Vionnet was one of the most important Parisian fashion houses of the 1930s. When WWII approached, a reorganization of the House was contemplated. Eventually, Vionnet decided to close her House. On August 2, 1939, Madeleine Vionnet showed her farewell collection. In 1952, years after the closing of her house, Madeleine Vionnet donated most of her designs to the archives of the UFAC (today part of the Musï¿½e de la Mode et du Textile in Paris) including 120 dresses from 1921 to 1939. In 1988 the Vionnet fashion house was revived by the Lummen family and specializes primarily in accessories and luxury goods. Plans to reintroduce new ready-to-wear collections were first rumoured in early 2000 and really took shape in February 2003 when Sheikh Majed Al-Sabah, owner of Villa Moda, a Kuwaiti luxury department store, announced to the press a strategic collaboration with the house. New Vionnet collections were to be designed under the helm of Maurizio Pecoraro but due to the Iraq war, the relaunch was delayed. In Autumn 2006 it has been announed that Sophia Kokosalaki will be taking over the creative design for the classic house of Vionnet. She is thrilled to death and is deep in the archives to absorb everything she can of the spirit of the great designer. The first new collection was unveiled to the public in December 2006 within the US edition of Vogue. From early 2007, this first new Vionnet collection became exclusively available in the house atelier in Paris and within Barneys New York flagship stores in the USA. Sophia Kokosalaki designed one more collection for the label before to be replaced in May 2007 by Marc Audibet, in an unexpected move from the house. Marc Audibet, appointed as artistic advisor, presented its sole and unique collection for the house in October 2007. However, in a new unexpected move, Marc Audibet resigned from the house who then appointed a pool of designers, without revealing their identities. In February 2008, Arnaud de Lummen told Women's Wear Daily that he wanted the focus to be on the label's expansion and not on its designers: ""Vionnet doesn't need to be associated with a designer's name, it's an institution."" From 2006 to 2008, Vionnet produced made-in-France ""demi-couture"" collections closed to haute-couture in the prices featured and the techniques and textiles used. Vionnet involved historical partners of the house, such as the couture embroiderer Lesage. On February 24, 2009, Matteo Marzotto announced the acquisition of the label and the creation of a new and independent structure in Milan where Vionnet is now operated. Matteo Marzotto, former General Manager and President of Valentino SpA, is one of the heirs of the Marzotto Group, a powerful textile group established in Italy since 1836. Matteo Marzotto also announced that some additional strategic development is to be provided by Gianni Castiglioni, CEO of the fashion brand Marni. Vionnet is now designed by Rodolfo Paglialunga who, prior to Vionnet, spent 13 years as a designer of womenswear at Prada, and the previous four years at Romeo Gigli",['https://www.facebook.com/pages/Vionnet-Official-Page/138448249501971'],"['Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Pre-Fall 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Pre-Fall 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012']","['Marc Audibet', 'Madeleine Vionnet', 'Sophia Kokosalaki']",1912.0,Madeleine Vionnet

Since inception, VPL has gradually evolved to include ready-to-wear, accessories, bags, and shoes, partnering with shoe designer Jean-Michel Cazabat and jewelry designers Alyssa Norton, Brian Crumley, and Josh Hickey. VPL collections usually hinge around a cheeky theme, such as the ï¿½Modern Suffragettesï¿½ homage in 2007, which presented a military slant on staples like effortless jersey separates. Diffusion line VPL2 was spun off in 2008, sticking to basics like tanks, knits, and underwear. From the design studio in New York City, Victoria Bartlett continues to be inspired by the unceasing city pulse, yet remains dedicated to the concept of visibility rather than invisibility (underwear, outerwear, anywhere).",['https://www.facebook.com/VPLNYC'],"['Spring/Summer 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2001']",['Victoria Bartlett'],2003.0,Victoria Bartlett

He also opened a boutique at Bloomingdales in New York. During the 70's while still based in Tokyo, Miyake began to show his collections twice a year in Paris and they rapidly became fashion shows which no fashion addict could afford to miss. In the late 80s, he began to experiment with new methods of pleating that would allow both flexibility of movement for the wearer as well as ease of care and production. This eventually resulted in a new technique called garment pleating and in 1993's in which the garments are cut and sewn first, then sandwiched between layers of paper and fed into a heat press, where they are pleated. The fabric's 'memory' holds the pleats and when the garments are liberated from their paper cocoon, they are ready-to wear. In 1994 and 1999, Miyake turned over the design of the men's and women's collections respectively, to his associate, Naoki Takizawa, so that he could return to research full-time. In 2000, after 30 years at the forefront of design, Issey Miyake announced that he would be handing over the reins of ready-to-wear to his right-hand man Naoki Takizawa (born 1960) who has been with him since 1989. For Spring 2000 Takizawa gave the Miyake main line new direction, with cropped jackets and fitted shift dresses in simple pared-down silhouettes and fluid shapes. In 2007, Naoki Takizawa opened his own brand, supported by the Issey Miyake Group and was replaced, as a Creative Director of the House of Issey Miyake, by Dai Fujiwara. Issey Miyake is not hanging up his scissors yet though. He says ""I want to go back to basics"". He will focus on the A-POC range pushing the concept that real clothes can be made from a single piece of cloth. His A-POC shop opened in Spring 2000 in London. Now, recently, he has opened a huge futuristic new store in Tokyo, Japan, in the same building wherein he had founded his company in 1971.

Jil Sander,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/jil-sander/,Milan,Italy,https://www.jilsander.com,['Jil Sander'],Change Capital Partners,"Jil Sander AG is a fashion house founded by Jil Sander in 1968. Its minimalist trademarks include striking silhouettes, high-end fabrics, and meticulous detail, emphasizing quality over flash. In the years after 1978 she revolutionized the industry by marketing her first perfume with a campaign that prominently featured her own face. The internationally successful cooperation with Lancaster Cosmetics allowed her financially to run ads in glamorous magazines on a large scale for her fashion. Later, licenses would be given for eyewear and leather accessory lines. In 1985, it was decided that her collections would be shown in Milan to more efficiently tackle the international markets. Initially much to the regret of the German media, the decision was the right thing to do. As a result, sales were steadily increasing. More fragrances were added to the cosmetics line, and the label's luxurious minimalism proved to be the hit of the mid to late 90's. Jil Sander AG went public in 1989 and was sold to shareholders on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Jil's fashion house was among the first to venture on such a step. She used the new capital to expand in Asia and North America. Her tremendous success overseas resulted in palatial flagship stores in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taipei among many others, whose interior furnishings gobbled up millions. Ms. Sander personally overlooked the design of her stores and strict guidelines were implemented for the sales staff on how to behave and where to stand in the boutiques. At the Paris store, opened in 1993, the Jil Sander collections could be shown on more than 9000 square feet and four floors. The space at Avenue Montaigne in Paris used to be French fashion designer Madeleine Vionnet's atelier and showroom, one whose work is often compared to that of Sander's. In 1998 Jil Sander and German sportswear house Puma jointly launched a successful sneakers collection. Jil Sander's success accumulated a fortune in the mid 1990's. Her company survived the economic crisis in Asia. A newly launched menï¿½s collection that had been postponed several times before in 1997 and was described as ""precision-cut with an emphasis upon light fabrics"", was largely successful. A desire with Ms. Sander to concentrate more on the creative design rather than the business, resulted in much praise and acclaim from the critics. Nevertheless, Jil needed a financially strong partner realizing that her company was steadily growning. Jil Sander AG was no longer a small privately owned business. In 1999 Prada Group bought a 75% share in her company. Ms. Sander, remained creative designer and became chairwoman in the new joint venture. Six months later, in January 2000, Ms. Sander unexpectedly left after confrontations with Prada CEO Patrizio Bertelli, a quick-tempered Italian businessman. She, an uncompromising perfectionist, refused in using cheaper materials and at bringing the traditionally slim fits in line with standard sizes. Mr. Bertelli had demanded of Jil, some very drastic cost cuts and a more affordable mainstream approach. Bertelli also insisted on giving up the contributary workshops in Germany in favor of the shops in Italy owned by Prada. Milan Vukmirovic, a former buyer from Colette and Gucci team designer, had been installed as Ms. Sanderï¿½s successor by Bertelli. He unsuccessfully tried to follow in her footsteps. Pressured by Prada to cater to a wider audience, Vukmirovic came up with mediocre but commercially viable sportswear collections in 2002 and 2003 that drove away longstanding Jil Sander patrons and failed to attract new customers. The company had been in the red since 2001. It was said that with rapidly sinking sales Prada Group had to go to huge expenses just to keep the house of Jil Sander going. To everyoneï¿½s surprise Ms. Sander, whose heart was probably bleeding when she looked at what Prada had made of her fashion house, returned to the company she had founded more than 30 years before as head designer and partner in May 2003, after her noncompete clause had expired. Supposedly, Bertelli had begged her to come back. Her sensational comeback was celebrated unanimously and with much fanfare by the international press. She designed two collections that were both shown in Milan, she altered Vukmirovicï¿½s existing sketches for the menï¿½s collection, she redesigned some of her boutiques and even sat down to go through the books herself. Everyone was certain that with the spirit of the company back in the house things would get well again. But in November 2004, Ms. Sander agreed to terminate cooperation with Prada and resigned from her post again after insurmountable differences with Mr. Bertelli. It is rumored that it had been Bertelliï¿½s turn to financially support the company, after Ms. Sander herself had made heavy investments, so that Jil Sander AG could be sold from Prada Group, already heavily indebted itself as the result of Mr. Bertelli's management. But apparently the banks refused Bertelli the necessary loans. Subsequently, the glamorous Jil Sander showroom in Hamburg was closed, production was entirely moved to Italy and of more than 300 jobs only about 50 remained. All that was left in Germany in early 2006 was an office for press, distribution and marketing personnel, the staff at the boutiques as well as the Hamburg atelier for the womenï¿½s collection. The corporation was supposed to be transformed into a holding company with the Italian subsidiaries taking over administrative and business duties. Prada Group still held a 98% stake in the company which generated losses of ï¿½10 million after taxes in the first half-year of 2005. The losses in 2004 had been almost ï¿½30 million. For the time after Ms. Sanderï¿½s departure an in-house design team was formed to take care of the collections. The slim fits, so typical of Jil Sander, had meanwhile been adjusted to mainstream sizes. In May 2005, it was announced that Raf Simons, a Belgian industrial designer who also has his own menï¿½s label (Link) and is a professor at Vienna's University of Applied Arts, had become creative director for the womenï¿½s and menï¿½s collection. Simonsï¿½ first womenï¿½s collection (he had never designed for women before) for the house of Jil Sander was shown at the February 2006 fashion shows in Milan. The collection received overwhelmingly favorable reviews from the critics (Reference: The Evening Standard) and was considered ""extraordinary, full of the kind of subtle details and sumptuous fabrics that will challenge the prevailing idea of luxury"" (Source: LA Times). To this day, the house produces only two pricey high-end lines, one for women and one for men. Ms. Sander herself had always been strictly against launching a secondary line or bridge collection. In late February 2006, Prada Group sold Jil Sander AG to London-based British private equity firm, Change Capital Partners (CCP), for an estimated $ 120 million. Founded by Luc Vandevelde, former CEO of Marks & Spencer and now also chairman of Carrefour, the buyout firm CCP specializes in middle market investments mainly in the fashion industry. Raf Simons remained creative director at Jil Sander. It was said that the tremendous success of his latest women's collection for the house was the ultimate trigger for CCP to invest. (Reference: The New York Times). CCP announced to expand the brand in the future which analysts expect to break even again in 2006 with sales estimated at around ï¿½ 140 million for the year.

John Galliano,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/john-galliano/,Paris,France,https://www.johngalliano.com,['John Galliano'],LVHM,"In 1984 Galliano unleashed his own label. More critical approval followed. His daring reinvention of romantic themes and delicate, superbly tailored garments were his trademarks. However, critical success was not matched by major financial success. He lost backers and did not have enough money to show for several seasons. In frustration, he quit London for Paris in the early 1990s. This was not an immediate solution. Several times Galliano was almost forced to declare bankruptcy. This was made all the more bitter by the fact that, while he struggled for money, his critical praise continued unabated. Fortunately, the admiration of the fashion community allowed him to continue. Fashion editors and critics were always busy trying to get work for Galliano, and models, like Kate Moss, worked for him out of friendship rather than money. In 1992 John Galliano presented his ""Princess Lucretia"" collection with extravagant crinolines. His 1994 collection was financed by John Bult, Swiss Chairman of Paine Webber International, an investment bank. It was held in the Paris mansion of Portuguese socialite Sao Schlumberger. The show made fashion headlines and had buyers rushing to order. No longer plagued by the unstable financial backing of a decade ago, Galliano is now part of the stable of luxury designer firms held by French conglomerate LVMH. In 1995, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault tapped Galliano as chief designer of Givenchyï¿½controversial, as he was the first Brit to hold the postï¿½then deposited him two years later as head of design at Christian Dior. Galliano now creates some dozen collections a year, including couture, ready-to-wear, accessories and eyewear for Dior, as well as directing his own eponymous label.",['https://www.facebook.com/JohnGallianoOfficial'],"['Spring/Summer 2019', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Spring/Summer 2005', 'Autumn/Winter 2005', 'Autumn/Winter 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2002', 'Spring/Summer 2002', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2000', 'Spring/Summer 1998', 'Autumn/Winter 1998', 'Autumn/Winter 1997', 'Spring/Summer 1997', 'Autumn/Winter 1996', 'Autumn/Winter 1996', 'Autumn/Winter 1995', 'Spring/Summer 1994', 'Autumn/Winter 1994', 'Autumn/Winter 1990', 'Spring/Summer 1990', 'Spring/Summer 1987', 'Spring/Summer 1987']",['John Galliano'],1984.0,John Galliano

In 1995, Gela and Pamela both residing in Pacoima, California, decided to create their own fashion label, Travis Jeans, selling maternity pants. In 1996 the girls changed the name to Juicy Couture, the aim was to create girly apparel and a label equal to that of other major labels, but to be more affordable to the general public. Their line, which they called ""Juicy Couture,"" was to include a variety of athletic and casual wear, most notably the velour tracksuit that won Juicy Couture a great deal of popularity. Taylor and Levy did not have much money with which to start their label, thus leading to a slow start-up of the company. In 1996, after establishing their company and needing to get the brand in the public eye, the women sent their completed designs to celebrities. Madonna, credited with turning the velour tracksuit into a trend, was sent a track suit with ""Madge"" embroidered on it (Juicy Couture rarely uses ""Madge"" on their clothing anymore). Madonna was seen wearing the tracksuit, and the company became a success almost instantly. Juicy Couture was a very limited brand, being available at very few locations such as Neiman Marcus; the company did not establish exclusive boutiques and flagship stores until the late 00's. Around 2004, the velour tracksuit once again became very popular, and Juicy Couture then became a worldwide known brand. The founders of Juicy Couture  have slowly introduced new merchandise to their lineup. In 1999, they introduced jeans to their product line called Juicy Jeans. In 2001, they revolutionized the fashion world with the introduction of the track suit, the item that the company is most famous for. These tracksuits come in a variety of colors made of velour, terry cloth, fleece, or cashmere, and consist of low riding draw string pants and a zip-up hoodie. In 2002, Juicy Couture added collections for men and children. In 2004, bathing suits and accessories for women, including shoes and jewelry, were also added to the Juicy line. Today, Juicyï¿½s offerings range from perfume, socks, and handbags to toiletries, diaper bags, and dog accessories. All of the Juicy Couture items are manufactured with the company signature logo, two highland terriers holding a shield bearing three hearts and Love G&P (for Gela and Pamela ). A crown lies overhead, while a Juicy Couture banner flutters above the slogan, ï¿½Made in the Glamorous USA.ï¿½ In 2006, Taylor and Levy introduced a new line called 'Couture Couture' consisting of 20 pieces and higher prices. This line reflects the new lifestyles of the two fashion designers, only carried in high ended stores. The first collection of loungewear and sleepwear by Choose Sleep by Juicy Couture Intimate Apparel was introduced in 2008. In 2008, the company added a plus-size line called ""Extra Juicy"". It was originally exclusive to Nordstrom stores, but is now widely available. The company also produced a men's line, but halted production in June 2009 when the menswear designer left the company. The company's only mens offering is now Dirty English by Juicy Couture fragrances which have been bought by Maria and shave lotion. Juicy Couture also has clothes and accessories for children, babies and pets. Juicy Couture is marketed as a high-end clothing line at an affordable price, and is aimed at women ages 10ï¿½26. In 2003, Liz Claiborne bought the company for a reported $53 million and a percent of future sales, but Nash-Taylor and Skaist-Levy are still the heart of Juicy Couture, with responsibility for creative direction as well as day-to-day operations. The line is sold in upscale department stores (Bloomingdale's, Gus Mayer, Lord & Taylor, Bergdorf Goodman, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue), as well as Juicy Couture flagship stores and boutiques.",['https://www.facebook.com/juicycouture'],['Autumn/Winter 2018'],['Pamela Skaist-Levy & Gela Nash-Taylor'],1995.0,Pamela Skaist-Levy

The concept of mixing collections on the runway is a modern way of showing clothes that mirrors the way people dress today. KARL LAGERFELD is a streetwise collection for men and women that exudes the energy of New York City. It is an accessibly priced line with high-end design sensibility.

The draping of scarves is a main motif, which occurs throughout the collection, from dresses to t-shirts to coats. The silhouettes go from skinny to wide, creating new and modern shapes. Subtle patchworks generate rich and innovative textures. The colors are brown with grey and black, setting an urban and contemporary tone. LAGERFELD COLLECTION is the evolution of Lagerfeld Gallery, Karl Lagerfelds Parisian collection. The Fall 2006 LAGERFELD COLLECTION emphasizes refined tailoring and intricately crafted details.

Kenzo Takada - the label's creator and inventor of new techniques such as cut knit - was the first to introduce the concept of volume and freedom of movement into clothing. Before leaving the House in 1999, he has inspired the creation teams with these amazing associations of colours, materials and prints that convey Kenzo’s values: freedom, cheerfulness and generosity. Joining LVMH in 1993, Kenzo has had a remarkable development. Now present in 270 outlets Kenzo designs include women, men and children's ready-to-wear, active sportswear, fashion accessories, fine leather goods, perfume, and home decoration. The arrival of Antonio Marras as artistic director of the Women universe last September will facilitate the renaissance of Kenzo and will accelerate further development. Very much in the spirit of Kenzo, Antonio Marras portrays a world both rich and poetic, mixing influences and forging links between the world of fashion and other forms of artistic expression. Inspired by the workshop, using cultural symbolism, Antonio Marras invents his own contemporary language, creates stunning clothes, each with their own story, imbuing women with freedom, authenticity and originality.

Lacoste,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/lacoste/,New York,USA,https://www.lacoste.com,['Renï¿½ Lacoste'],Lacoste,"Lacoste is a French apparel company founded in 1933 that sells high-end clothing, footwear, perfume, leather goods, watches, eyewear, and most famously, tennis shirts. The company can be recognized by its green crocodile logo. The company is currently run by the Lacoste family. Procter and Gamble is license-holder for the fragrance line. Lacoste is headquartered in Paris. Lacoste currently has its production capital in Troyes, France, though they delegate production of international clothing to numerous factories in over 12 countries around the world, including those found in Peru, Morocco, Indonesia, Romania and Italy. After a 2 year search in the Central American region, Lacoste established production for its US customers in the Miramar Free Trade Zone in El Salvador. El Salvador operations will be managed by a new the local subsidiary Textil El Salvador (TRANS). Renï¿½ Lacoste was a famous tennis player who achieved fame in two areas: tennis and fashion. After he retired from tennis, Lacoste founded La Chemise Lacoste in 1933 with Andrï¿½ Gillier, the owner and President of the largest French knitwear manufacturing firm at the time. They began to produce the revolutionary tennis shirt Lacoste had designed and worn on the tennis courts with the crocodile logo embroidered on the chest, serving as the first example of a brand name appearing on the outside of an article of clothing. In addition to tennis shirts, Lacoste produced shirts for golf and sailing. In 1951, the company began to expand as it branched from ""tennis white"" and introduced color shirts. In 1952 the shirts were exported to the United States and advertised as ""the status symbol of the competent sportsman"", influencing the clothing choices of the upper-class. In 1963, Bernard Lacoste took over the management of the company from his father Renï¿½. Significant company growth was seen under Bernard's management. When he became president, around three hundred thousand Lacoste products were sold annually. The Lacoste brand reached its height of popularity in the US during the late 1970s and became the signature 1980's ""preppy"" wardrobe item, even getting mentioned in Lisa Birnbach's Official Preppy Handbook of 1980. The company also began to introduce other products into their line including shorts, perfume, optical and sunglasses, tennis shoes, deck shoes, walking shoes, watches, and various leather goods. In the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, Izod and Lacoste were often used interchangeably because starting in the 1950s, Izod produced clothing known as Izod Lacoste under license for sale in the U.S. This partnership ended in 1993, when Lacoste regained exclusive U.S. rights to distribute shirts under its own brand. In 1977, Le Tigre Clothing was founded in an attempt to directly compete with Lacoste in the US market, selling a similar array of apparel, but featuring a tiger in place of the signature Lacoste crocodile. More recently, Lacoste's popularity has surged due to French designer Christophe Lemaireï¿½s work to create a more modern, upscale look. In 2005, almost fifty million Lacoste products sold in over one hundred and ten countries. Its visibility has increased due to the contracts between Lacoste and several young tennis players, including American tennis star Andy Roddick and French rising young prospect Richard Gasquet. Lacoste has also begun to increase its presence in the golf world, where noted 2 time Master champion, Josï¿½ Marï¿½a Olazï¿½bal and Scottish golfer Colin Montgomerie have been seen sporting Lacoste shirts in tournaments. Bernard Lacoste became seriously ill in early 2005, which led him to transfer the presidency of Lacoste to his younger brother and closest collaborator for many years, Michel Lacoste. Bernard died in Paris on March 21, 2006. As of 2006, Lacoste licenses its trademark to various companies. For example, Devanlay owns the exclusive worldwide clothing license, Pentland Brands has the exclusive worldwide license to produce Lacoste footwear, Procter & Gamble owns the exclusive worldwide license to produce fragrance, and Samsonite holds the worldwide license to produce Lacoste bags and small leather goods. In June 2007, Lacoste introduced their very first e-commerce site for the US market. Lacoste operates a large number of Lacoste boutiques worldwide; located as concessions in leading department stores and also as independent venue stores. In the UK, Lacoste is available from many leading high-end shops including KJ Beckett and John Lewis Partnership. Likewise in the US, the Lacoste brand can be found in stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, and other independent retailers. In Canada, Lacoste is sold in Harry Rosen,its own boutiques, and other independent retailers. In Australia, Lacoste is sold in David Jones. As of June 2007, Lacoste's online presence allows Americans to purchase clothing and have items shipped directly to their doors.

Lanvin,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/lanvin/,Paris,France,https://www.lanvin.com,['Jeanne Lanvin'],Harmonie S.A.,"When Lanvin died in 1946, ownership of the firm was ceded to the designer's daughter, who shared management of the firm from 1942 with a cousin and then a fashion-industry expert. Because Marie-Blanche de Polignac was childless when she died in 1958, the ownership of the House of Lanvin went to a cousin, Yves Lanvin. (See Directors and Officiers Since Jeanne Lanvin below.) The company has shuttled from here and there, beginning in March 1989 when Britain's Midland Bank bought a stake in the company from the family. The bank brought in Lï¿½on Bressler to revamp the firm's faded image. However, February 1990, Midland backed out and sold Lanvin to Orcofi, the French holding company led by the Vuitton family. From Orcofi, 50% of the House of Lanvin was acquired by L'Orï¿½al in 1994, 66% in 1995 and 100% in 1996. Under L'Orï¿½al's far-too-diverse umbrella, an array of CEOs who circulate within the French fashion industry directed the company. August 2001, Lanvin, the oldest fashion house still in operation, was taken private again by investor group Harmonie S.A., headed by Mrs. Shaw-Lan Wang, a Taiwanese media magnate. And, October 2001, Alber Elbaz was appointed the Lanvin artistic director for all activities, including interiors, and he has conducted his responsibilities in a highly personal, hands-on manner.

Loewe,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/loewe/,Madrid,Spain,https://www.loewe.es,['Enrique Loewe Roessberg'],,"The story of Loewe dates back to 1846, with the founding of a leather goods workshop in Calle Lobo (now known Calle Echegaray) in the heart of Madrid. In 1872, German artisan Enrique Loewe Roessberg came to the Spanish capital Madrid and set up in partnership with the workshop. Twenty years later in 1892, now known as E. Loewe, the firm opened a shop in the cityï¿½s Calle Prï¿½ncipe. Its huge advertising poster became an icon of its day and this budding leather goods business finally caught the public eye. In 1905, when Enrique Loewe Hilton headed up the Loewe business, King Alfonso XII awarded it the title of Purveyor of the Royal Household. Five years later, in 1910, Loewe opened its first shop in Barcelona. It was not until 1923 that Loewe began to open more shops in the capital, starting at 7, Calle Barquillo. In 1934, Enrique Loewe Knappe took over during a period that was to see further expansion, with a series of openings, including a boutique at 8, Gran Vï¿½a in 1939, which even today bears all the trappings of its original style. In 1945, designer Pï¿½rez de Rozas created the boxcalf bags that would soon become the companyï¿½s greatest classic. In 1959, Loewe opened a shop on Madridï¿½s Calle Serrano which was to upturn the stereotype associated with luxury goods shops. The year 1963 saw the beginning of Loeweï¿½s international expansion when a shop opened in London. With the arrival of the 70s, Loewe started to create its own womenï¿½s ready-to-wear and designed its first scarves. The same year, Vicente Vela created the legendary Loewe anagram. The brandï¿½s first perfume ï¿½ L by Loewe ï¿½ arrived in 1972. A year later Loewe opened its first shop in Japan, marking the beginning of its expansion into Asia. In 1974, Dario Rossi designed the Suede-Gold collection which marked an era and one year later, Loewe launched its Loewe pour homme fragrance which swiftly took the lionï¿½s share of the market. Nappa, designed by Renzo Zengiaro, appeared in 1979, replacing reinforced bags with a virtually structure-less version. The Aire by Loewe fragrance soon became a Spanish market leader when it was launched in 1985, a position it still maintains today. Loeweï¿½s first shop for men opened on Madridï¿½s chic Calle Serrano in 1986. In 1987, Loewe struck a deal with luxury goods group LVMH to boost international expansion. It launched Esencia by Loewe the same year. Since 1988, Loewe has also had its own foundation. The initiative came from Enrique Loewe, building on the consolidated position of this established business. Every year, the Loewe Foundation awards an international poetry prize. In 1996, Loewe celebrated its 150th anniversary, the same year it took over LVMH. One year later, designer Narciso Rodrï¿½guez took charge of womenï¿½s ready-to-wear and Loewe fashions featured on the Paris Catwalk for the first time. Shortly afterwards, Josï¿½ Enrique Oï¿½a Selfa took the reins, making his debut with the autumn-winter 03/04 collection. Now, Loewe is in the midst of an ambitious modernisation plan with a new creative director. Designer Stuart Vevers will take up his post in January 2008.",['https://www.facebook.com/LOEWE'],"['Spring/Summer 2025', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2005', 'Spring/Summer 2005', 'Autumn/Winter 2002', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Autumn/Winter 1998']","['Narciso Rodriguez', 'Jose Enrique Ona Selfa', 'Stuart Vevers']",1872.0,Enrique Loewe Roessberg

With the start of industrialization in the final quarter of the century, the family moved its business to Valsesia and founded Lanificio F.lli Lore e Compagnia, followed by Lanificio di Quarona di Zignone & C. in the same headquarters at the beginning of the 20th century. The present company was established on 4th April 1924 by Pietro Loro Piana, who was a firm believer in both technological and product innovation. He decided to create a forward-thinking company that could keep up with the rapidly changing times and founded “Ing. Loro Piana & C.” in Corso Rolandi, which is sill the Group’s corporate headquarters today. Franco Loro Piana, nephew of the company’s founder Pietro, took over the running of the company in 1941. He successfully made a name for the company as a supplier of fine fabrics for the “haute couture” industry, which was a growing phenomenon in the post-war period. Under the guidance of Franco Loro Piana the company rapidly enters the international markets such as Europe, America and Japan, exporting selected wools and fine fibres, such as cashmere. Franco had also the great capability of knowing how to strengthen in the company the love for cashmere and the dedication to quality. During the early 70s Franco Loro Piana’s sons, Sergio and Pier Luigi, took over his responsibilities, taking the corporation to worldwide leadership in the sector. The 80s represent a fundamental milestone of the company’s evolution, with the opening of Loro Piana subsidiaries in the United States and Japan and the launch of the first finished products. The company is then organized into two divisions: Luxury Goods and Textile. The first directly operated store opened in New York in 1993. The first Italian directly operated stores opened in Milan and Venice. In 2006 the Loro Piano Interiors were launched, a new business unit within the Textile Division, offering an exclusive collection of fabrics for interiors and furnishing. Today Loro Piano owns 135 stores worldwide that distribute luxury sportswear and leisurewear for men, women and children, knitwear, accessories, home collection, bags, shoes, and small leather goods, and one of the most complete made-to-measure services available in the market.",['https://www.facebook.com/LoroPiana'],['Autumn/Winter 2022'],[],1924.0,Pietro Loro Piana

Louis Vuitton,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/louis-vuitton/,Paris,France,https://www.vuitton.com,['Louis Vuitton'],,"The Louis Vuitton Company (more commonly known simply as Louis Vuitton) is a luxury French fashion and leather goods brand and company, headquartered in Paris, France. It is a division of the French holding company, LVMH Louis Vuitton Moï¿½t Hennessy S.A. The company is named after its founder Louis Vuitton (August 41821-February 271892), who designed and manufactured luggage, as a Malletier during the second half of the nineteenth century. The company manufactures and markets luxury leather goods, fashion accessories, prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter, and jewelry. Many of the companyï¿½s products utilize the signature brown Damier and Monogram Canvas materials, both of which were first used in the late 19th century. All of the companyï¿½s products utilize the eponymous LV initials. The company only markets its product through its own stores throughout the world, which allows it to control product quality and pricing, and to prevent counterfeit products entering its distribution channels. In addition, the company added a single online retailer to sell some of its products (along with some of its sister companies such as Christian Dior). One hundred and fifty years after its eponymous founder began creating and selling trunks in Paris, Louis Vuitton's signature leather goods are considered a status symbol around the globe and are highly regarded in the fashion world. The company's iconic Monogram Canvas design can be considered the first designer label in contemporary history; the design was created in 1896 by Vuitton's son Georges and was intended to prevent counterfeiting. The Louis Vuitton company carefully cultivates a celebrity following and has used famous models and actresses in its marketing campaigns, most recently Lauren Vaughan and Ashlee Gilbertson. Other models and actresses who have lent their name to the Louis Vuitton line include Opal Mackinnon, George Conway, Christina Ricci, Gisele Bundchen, Kate Moss, Scarlett Johansson and Naomi Campbell. Hayden Christensen has also appeared as model for the company's luggage and prï¿½t-ï¿½-porter lines. Breaking from their usual traditions of employing supermodels and celebrities to advertise their products, on August 2, 2007 the company announced that the former USSR leader Mikhail Gorbachev would appear in an ad campaign along with Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi, and Catherine Deneuve. The company commonly uses print ads in magazines and billboards in cosmopolitan cities. Vuitton bags and purses have a considerable list of celebrity adherents who are frequently seen in tabloid and magazine photographs carrying the brand. The Vuitton collection has also created a cult-like following among male and female consumers throughout the world. Owners of the bags and accessories often refer to the products as their ï¿½Louis.ï¿½ This cult following by both celebrities and wealthy consumers has elevated the Vuitton brand to the foremost position in accessory design alongside houses such as Gucci, Prada, Fendi, Hermï¿½s and Dior. The brand is highly counterfeited, and just over 1% of the items bearing the trademark  monogram are authentic. Ironically, the signature Monogram Canvas was created to prevent counterfeiting. In 2004, Louis Vuitton fakes accounted for 18% of counterfeit accessories seized in the European Union. LVMH, Vuitton's parent company, said that it employed ""some 60 people at various levels of responsibility working full time on anti-counterfeiting, in collaboration with a wide network of outside investigators and a team of lawyers."" Innovation at Louis Vuitton is blended with tradition. The House is associated with major events which reflect its passion for excellence. The Louis Vuitton Classic is the event of the year for automobile collectors from all over the world, while the Louis Vuitton Cup decides the challenger for the America's Cup, the most prestigious trophy in international yachting. Continually expanding, Louis Vuitton today boasts 15 production workshops, an international logistics center, more than 390 exclusive shops worldwide.",['https://www.facebook.com/LouisVuitton'],"['Cruise 2025', 'Spring/Summer 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2024', 'Cruise 2024', 'Pre-Fall 2024', 'Pre-Fall 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Resort 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Pre-Fall 2023', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Resort 2022', 'Pre-Fall 2022', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2021', 'Spring/Summer 2021', 'Spring/Summer 2021', 'Spring 2021', 'Resort 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Resort 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Cruise 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Cruise 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Resort 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Pre-Fall 2015', 'Resort 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Pre-Fall 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Resort 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Resort 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Spring/Summer 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2005', 'Spring/Summer 2005', 'Spring/Summer 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2002', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2000', 'Autumn/Winter 1999', 'Autumn/Winter 1998']","['Louis Vuitton', 'Marc Jacobs', 'Judy Blame']",1896.0,Louis Vuitton

Missoni,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/missoni/,Milan,Italy,https://www.missoni.com,['Ottavio and Rosita Missoni now Angela Missoni'],Missoni SpA,"Missoni is a Milan-based fashion house in Italy founded by Rosita and Ottavio (better known as Tai) Missoni, famous for unique ready-to-wear knits. Missoni exemplifies success in a specific fashion area, knitwear for men and women. In the knitwear business since 1953, the business begun by Ottavio (Tai) and Rosita Missoni took off with recognition by Anna Piaggi in 1965 and was one of the landmark enterprises of the Italian renaissance in postwar fashion products through the 1960s and 1970s. In 1968 and 1969, Missoni garnered worldwide attention for knit dresses, coats, and sweaters that revived the sensational appeal of knits in the 1920s. From a start in producing the finest knits, the Missoni repertory came to include pullovers, long coats, chemises, trousers, and skirts. Even more, in the 1970s, the Missonis' deliberate allegiance to Milan heralded that city's eminence as a fashion center and helped create Milan fashion week. In 1997 Angela took the reins of the company and over the next few years increased brand awareness through a wide range of licensing, from rugs to footwear. New flagships in New York and Paris were opened, while a new bridge line, M Missoni, was introduced for spring-summer 1999. By the early 2000s, Missoni was more than a vital force in knitwear; the firm had gone far beyond its founders' original vision to encompass Missoni designs for an entire lifestyle. Aside from the main Missoni line, the company has diversified into a variety of luxury goods. Missoni Sport was initially licensed out but production and marketing was brought in-house in January 2002 and has since been discontinued. M Missoni is a less expensive line introduced in 1998, manufactured and distributed by Marzotto (now Valentino Fashion Group S.p.A). It has achieved remarkable success in being able to reach a larger number of consumers and is now being sold at premier department and specialty stores across the world. The Missoni Home collection has its roots in furnishing fabrics produced in 1981 in collaboration with Rosita's family firm. They launched their first perfume in 1982, although that product has nothing to do with the license now held by Estï¿½e Lauder. In November 2005, Missoni and RezidorSAS Hospitality signed an agreement to open a lifestyle hotel chain of the same name: Hotel Missoni. In March 2006, the first Missoni locations were announced for Kuwait City, Edinburgh, and Dubai. Hotel Missoni Kuwait will be the group's first property in the world, opening in a luxury mixed-use development on the seafront in the third quarter of 2007. The Edinburgh property will open in late 2008, while the Dubai hotel will debut at the end of 2008.",['https://www.facebook.com/missoni'],"['Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2023', 'Spring/Summer 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2022', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Spring/Summer 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Resort 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Resort 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Resort 2013', 'Resort 2013', 'Pre-Fall 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Resort 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Pre-Fall 2011', 'Pre-Fall 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2008', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Autumn/Winter 2007', 'Spring/Summer 2007', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Spring/Summer 2006', 'Spring/Summer 2005', 'Autumn/Winter 2005', 'Spring/Summer 2004', 'Autumn/Winter 2004', 'Spring/Summer 2003', 'Autumn/Winter 2003', 'Spring/Summer 2002', 'Autumn/Winter 2002', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Autumn/Winter 2000', 'Spring/Summer 2000', 'Autumn/Winter 1999', 'Spring/Summer 1999', 'Spring/Summer 1998', 'Autumn/Winter 1998', 'Autumn/Winter 1997', 'Spring/Summer 1997', 'Spring/Summer 1996', 'Autumn/Winter 1995', 'Autumn/Winter 1995']",['Ottavio and Rosita Missoni now Angela Missoni'],1953.0,Rosita and Ottavio Missoni

Nina Ricci designed gowns while Robert managed the business and finances. She worked with the fabrics directly on the mannequin to ensure they had shape once they were finished. Nina Ricci designs soon became known for the refined, romantic, always feminine feeling Maria adds to all of her collections. In 1945, with the war over, designers were casting about for a way to revive the infatuation women had formerly had with haute couture, while raising money for war relief. Robert Ricci had an idea which Lucien Lelong, President of the Chambre, put into action. Over 150 mannequins from 40 Paris couturiers, including Balenciaga and Madame Gres, were dressed in the labels' best fashions and were placed in an exhibition held at the Louvre, in Paris. After a huge success in Paris it toured Europe and then the USA. In 1946 Robert created his first fragrance, Coeur Jolie. In 1948 Robert came up with another fragrance, Lï¿½Air du Temps, the brand's most popular fragrance, which continues to be a top seller today. By the early 50s Nina Ricci was nearing 70 and she slowly she ceased to take an active role in design, choosing to just keep an eye on the house. Her son chose the new head designer in 1954, the Belgian Jules-Francois Crahay. Crahay left Ricci in 1963 to go to Lanvin, and was immediately replaced by Gerard Pipart, who had worked at Balmain, Fath and Jean Patou prior to his new job. He continued to carry on the name of Ricci with beautiful and elegant dresses. After Maria Ricci's death in 1970, Crahay was appointed head of the house. Robert continued to excel in perfumery and business until his death in 1988. Massimo Guissain's family purchased the house of Nina Ricci in 1998 from Crahay. Massimo Guissain worked as a designer, but Nathalie Gervais had been the chief designer for the house for several years. She presented her last collection in Fall 2001. In May 2002 American designer James Aguiar took over as chief designer and designed for the House of Ricci for two seasons. In 2003 Lars Nilsson took over the house of Ricci with shaky reviews from critics. He made a sudden redesign in early 2006, and then in September announced that Brussels-born designer Olivier Theyskens of Rochas would take over the role as head of the label.",['https://www.facebook.com/ninaricci'],"['Autumn/Winter 2024', 'Spring/Summer 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2021', 'Spring/Summer 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2020', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2019', 'Autumn/Winter 2018', 'Spring/Summer 2018', 'Autumn/Winter 2017', 'Spring/Summer 2017', 'Autumn/Winter 2016', 'Spring/Summer 2016', 'Autumn/Winter 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2015', 'Spring/Summer 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Pre-Fall 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2013', 'Autumn/Winter 2013', 'Spring/Summer 2012', 'Autumn/Winter 2012', 'Spring/Summer 2011', 'Autumn/Winter 2011', 'Spring/Summer 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2010', 'Autumn/Winter 2009', 'Spring/Summer 2009', 'Autumn/Winter 2008', 'Spring/Summer 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2006', 'Autumn/Winter 2005', 'Spring/Summer 2001', 'Autumn/Winter 2001', 'Autumn/Winter 1990']","['Maria Nielli', 'Olivier Theyskens']",1932.0,"Maria ""Nina"" Ricci"

The company, originally known in Italy as ""Prada Brothers"", was founded in 1913 by Mario Prada in Milan. In 1978, Mario's granddaughter Miuccia Prada inherited what was still a leather goods business from her mother, and led the company's expansion into couture with an overall more bohemian style. Miu Miu is a second line of clothing, often simpler and evoking a continual image of high-end vintage items. It was followed by the Prada Sport 'Linea Rossa' Currently Prada is considered one of the most influential clothing designers in the fashion industry. Following the lead of other companies in a popular trend to absorb as many other fashion houses as possible, Prada took on large debts when it acquired the financially floundering Rome-based house of Fendi in the early 1990s. Prada assumed shares in Fendi with the LVMH company. Prada was unable to turn around/support the money-losing Fendi label, and sold its Fendi shares to LVMH. Prada is still recovering from this debt. In 1999, the company acquired Church's, the English maker of quality shoes; more recently a 45% stake has been sold to Equinox. The Prada Group's other notable purchases in the 1990s were the Helmut Lang and Jil Sander labels. By 2006, however, both labels had been sold. Jil Sander was sold to the private equity firm Change Capital Partners, which is headed by Luc Vandevelde, the chairman of Carrefour, while the Helmut Lang label is now owned by Japanese fashion company Link Theory. In May of 2007, Prada joined forces with cell phone maker LG Electronics to create the LG Prada (KE850) phone. It retails for $800. Prada has 9 boutiques and 3 epicenter/megastores in the U.S., with a 4th epicenter store being built in Boston.

Theory,https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/theory/,New York,USA,https://www.theory.com,['Lucas Ossendrijver'],Link International,"Theory was founded in 1997 on the principle that men and women want to feel comfortable and sexy in modern clothing. Theory is geared to answer the needs of a contemporary customer, one who has a demanding and versatile lifestyle. Sophisticated, urban, and discriminating, yet seeking comfort and value. In 1991 Theory launched ist first Menï¿½s Colleciton. Theory defined its customer as global, intelligent, and fashion-savvy. Placing a premium on fit and fabric quality, Theory created a collection of stand alone pieces that serve as the foundation of our consumer's wardrobe. Theory incorporated the successful merchandising models of American fashion companies, with the quality and craftsmanship of European fashion houses. By merging the two ideologies Theory has been able to deliver a superior product. Theory seized the technological opportunities available to spin Lycra into other fabrics, creating slimmer, more comfortable shapes. Theory's signature ""stretch"" fit developed a cult following and the Theory pant became a must-have for every woman's wardrobe. In 2003, Link International purchased Theory LLC to form Link Theory Holdings, giving Theory the ability to grow strategically with an emphasis on global positioning and expansion. Theory opened its Global Headquarters in New York City's Meatpacking District in 2006. The building houses Theory's flagship store on the ground level and four floors dedicated to central operations. The urban design house represents Theory's creative process: open, connected and inspired. In 2009, Link Theory Holdings joined the Fast Retailing family of brands to further extend Theoryï¿½s presence throughout the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In 2010, Theory continues to evolve and grow its global presence while remaining grounded in its founding principles: a simple design philosophy, clean silhouettes, quality, craftsmanship and fit. Theoryï¿½s emphasis has always been on the clothes.",['https://www.facebook.com/theory'],"['Spring/Summer 2024', 'Autumn/Winter 2014', 'Autumn/Winter 2012']",[],1991.0,Lucas Ossendrijver

The Company additionally entered into a long-term contract with Mr. Karl Lagerfeld to continue to design and provide creative direction for the brand. In less than two decades, the Company has grown from a single line of business to one that encompasses several core operations that work in concert to extend the scope of the brand and meet the many needs of a customer following that includes children, teens, and adults of all races, backgrounds and nationalities.
