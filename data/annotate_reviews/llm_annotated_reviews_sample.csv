Christian Lacroix,fall-2004-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2004-ready-to-wear/christian-lacroix,"Christian Lacroix returned to a real runway show this season after taking a 2-year hiatus, and looking at the clothes, it felt as if he'd never been away. Lacroix marches to his own drum, which means that there have been moments when he was been out of step with the rest of the fashion world (during the minimalism of the late nineties, for example). These days, of course, color and ornamentation have become the look du jour; so it should, by rights, be a Lacroix moment.If only it were that simple. It's not hard to expect that Lacroix's break from shows, plus his success at Pucci, might have pushed him forward a bit. Yet it felt that things hadn't quite gotten up to speed. He's still just as assured in matters of decoration and color, and his silhouette was much less complicated than in the past. What worked was a plaid trench and blouson, a slim metallic floral coat, and, for evening, an Edwardian-looking lace blouse and floor-sweeping ruffled skirt. But his approach to putting all this together could get a little fussy and overwrought. Sure, odd-looking huge floral corsages are obviously meant just for runway wear, but they still detract from the clothes underneath.If Lacroix needs a fresh direction, he could perhaps take a lesson from his own menswear. The few pieces he showed (it's a new venture for him) had all his characteristic richness—the claret velvet blazer with pink-and-khaki-checked tweed trousers or the gray tweed coat worn over a baby-blue hoodie—but worn with a beautifully modern, casual ease.",Mark Holgate,"March 8, 2004","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/55c650d408298d8be216dea5/master/w_1280,c_limit/00010f.jpg",,fall,2004,ready-to-wear,2000,Christian Lacroix,1951.0,,"returned to a real runway show this season after taking a 2 - year hiatus , and looking at the clothes , it felt as if he 'd never been away . marches to his own drum , which means that there have been moments when he was been out of step with the rest of the fashion world ( during the minimalism of the late nineties , for example ) .

Jil Sander,resort-2020,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2020/jil-sander,"Simplicityis a key word for Jil Sander’s Luke and Lucie Meier. Their design relies on clean, essential lines, almost minimal in their purity, but there’s nothing basic in their rather conceptual approach. In their case, simplicity rhymes more withfinessethan withplainness. Having an appreciation for craft and the sophistication that goes into the minute details they favor, their style is tinged with an elevated folksy attitude.For Resort, they injected a touch of playfulness into the mix, to ease their sometimes too rigorous m.o.: “The silhouette is very elongated, very lean,” said Luke. “It follows the body line, but then it breaks with a playful gesture, like tying something around the waist, be it a belt, a sweater, or a leather waist bag. Trying to convey a sense of lightness and movement.”Cases in point were a striped poplin shirtdress with a matching masculine shirt casually tied around the waist, and an obi-inspired belt draped around a white ottoman cotton canvas chemise, worn over a handmade raffia-crocheted skirt. Mitigating further the elegant severity inherent to the designers’ approach, oversize proportions were reduced and softened, as in a white apron-sundress tightly smocked, its hem ending in a crisp, graceful flounce. Or else shoulders were cut rounded and feminine, as in a black cotton trapeze blouse paired with a matching ankle-grazing asymmetrical skirt; or again, in a white linen A-line midi dress, where the shoulder line had a neat lightness, precise and softly sculptural.Even tailoring, one of the brand’s strong points, was rendered with a softer edge. “We like tailoring because it’s handmade,” said Luke. “It’s not an industrial product. For us, elegance comes down to an appreciation for the care and refinement that goes into things well made.” This is why craft and handwork give their collections a modern folksy feel. Tie-dye Shibori techniques were used as decorative elements on a loose shirt-skirt ensemble, like red abstract poppies blooming on a tobacco raw-silk-canvas field. Elsewhere, white tie-dye motifs lit up an indigo blue cotton blouse. Along the same lines, flowery raffia crochet patches were stitched on a long black plissé skirt with crisp striped inserts. Worn with a tailored blazer and a white sculpted blouse in ottoman cotton canvas, it looked polished and cool.Underlining the imaginative feel, looks were completed with playful accessories: Japanese-inspired chunky wooden platforms with braided laces; flat sandals trailing raffia fringed tassels; flower-shaped sculptural earrings; and pearl pendants. Extra-large straw shopping bags evoked a crescent moon, while a bohemian fringy shoulder bag concealed a rigid boxy purse on the inside. They revealed a poetic, quirky side of the designers’ aesthetic. Breaking free from control can open up clever new perspectives.",Tiziana Cardini,"May 22, 2019","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ce56372d90148f0a15a6af6/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-jil-sander-resort-20.jpg",,resort,2020,other,2020,Luke Meier,,Fashion Institute of Technology,"a key word for Jil Sander ’s Luke and .

Maison Rabih Kayrouz,fall-2018-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2018-ready-to-wear/maison-rabih-kayrouz,"For the first time since 2014, Rabih Kayrouz presented his collections outside his Left Bank maison, hosting guests at the American Cathedral where “It’s Couture Baby” glared in red neon from wood paneling that temporarily replaced the altar. Deduction might lead to a sacred/profane dichotomy, but in lighter terms and on the final day of shows, the signage was suitably irreverent. And as Kayrouz would explain postshow, the point was actually one of semantics.Attend enough of his presentations and it becomes clear that his clients are diverse in background and discerning in taste. Unlike the industry at large, they probably don’t dwell on which collection he shows and when; they just appear when invited and eventually place their orders. Visits to his atelier come close to a couture experience, no matter what is or isn’t being purchased. Accordingly, the lineup today included Pre-Fall, Fall ’18 ready-to-wear, and yes, a few couture designs, too. “This is my work; this is my collection; this is the work I like to do for the women I love,” he said.Some of those women walked in the show, including jewelry designer Noor Fares and the ever-amiable French journalist Sophie Fontanel. There was also star dancer Marie-Agnès Gillot, who performed intermittently in a bright orange dress that accommodated her full range of passionately agitated movements. At the end of the show, with Fares wearing an ivory dress fit for an architecturally minded wedding, they became the designer’s Three Graces: beauty, charm, and creativity in equal measure.Mentioning these details conveys what is not immediately discernible in the draping of a gabardine coat or the outward angle of a cuff. The collection was well represented by beautiful, smooth planes—on a cashmere jacket with no closures; a high-neck ivory sleeveless dress verging downward; and long coats that flowed around the body. Yet Kayrouz is not so much a minimalist—for proof, consider his couture pieces featuring 18th-century fabric patches shielded between tulle—as a purist who judiciously employs color to bold effect. Sometimes you get the sense he’ll show an allover orange suit simply because it is necessary to his compositional balance, not to your wardrobe. The presence of brocades, on the other hand, would reflect well on all parties—with the coordinating relaxed separates more original than the admittedly excellent dresses.More than usual, his unstructured designs came with built-in attitude—which was further enhanced by his sculptural jewelry. If these pieces sometimes felt too large for the bodies that wore them, they were absorbed by the scale of space. And in this way, it was nice to see Kayrouz thinking big.",Amy Verner,"January 25, 2018","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a6a426c5bf3a12adf433d34/master/w_1280,c_limit/01-Maison-Rabih-Kayrouz-Fall-2018.jpg",,fall,2018,ready-to-wear,2010,,,,"For the first time since 2014 , presented his collections outside his Left Bank maison , hosting guests at where “ It ’s Couture Baby ” glared in red neon from wood paneling that temporarily replaced the altar .

Prada,spring-2003-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2003-ready-to-wear/prada,"Miuccia Prada has trained the fashion world to expect—indeed, to crave—the unexpected from her shows. Even those audience members who came dressed head to toe in her winter “sex” collection were there to see which sharp new turn she would take next. They were not to be disappointed. The designer let her fall Helmut Newton-esque fantasy evaporate in favor of something much cleaner, rearranging all her hallmarks—a love of couture fabrics, an obsession with the ’60s, and the ability to appropriate ethnic touches and play with modernist cuts—as never before.She opened with bright, singing color: a neon-pink cheongsam shirt with an orange-sorbet short skirt, both in luxurious duchesse satin. And by accessorizing the look with sporty goggles, thrust on top of the head, and flat silver sandals, she steered well clear of any literal vintage reference. The same mind-set could be seen at work in a sequence of white T-shirt pieces decorated with patches of plastic beading, and in a pair of Bermudas cut from shiny couture-like brocade and worn with a racer-back tank. Prada reinvented jewelry, too, tying on flat leather breast pieces encrusted with plastic beads or fusing them into the necklines of bra-top jersey dresses.The best measure of the collection’s success was that nothing was complicated, despite the complex merging of sport, color, luxury and ’60s elements.

It has taken a while, but Mohapatra has finally learned to be judicious with his flourishes. This collection was marked by that discipline: He limited himself to one decorative idea—a flock-like pattern inspired the look of a part of India colonized by the French—and he kept his shapes simple, too, emphasizing structured sheaths. There was also a nice sense of communication between Mohapatra's evening looks and his clothes for day. If he overdid anything here, it was his focus; after a while, his repetition of the flock became a bit tiresome, especially in an embroidered leather iteration that just didn't work.

Chanel,spring-2016-couture,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2016-couture/chanel,"“Fashion is part of the events of our times,” declaredKarl Lagerfeldabout the Zen-like, eco-conscious serenity of theChanelHaute Couture collection in the Grand Palais. Reacting to the times (especially in an age as troubled as ours) can also mean needing to detach from them, fashion-mindfulness equated with luxury in this case. So where last October there was the high-tech, noisy hurly-burly of theChanel Airport, now there were the lush green lawns of a minimalist garden, water lily ponds, a slatted wood pavilion, and plenty of space and calm to contemplate it all under simulated blue skies. It seemed incredible that the same venue had been transformed into a convincing casino for the last couture show—a tribute to the set-design genius at Chanel—and just as incredible that this time, the gambling chips had been replaced by . . . wood chips.You read correctly: Wood chips were used as beading, paillettes, and 3-D frills among techniques involving recycled paper and organic woven yarn. The wedding look—a dreamy tufted hoodie, dress, and train—was all “made from wild cotton,” said Lagerfeld, quipping, “This is high-fashion ecology. It must not look like some sloppy demonstration!”A case could be built for haute couture being the most non-environmentally impactful branch of clothing production, anyway. It’s handmade, takes infinite hours of work, and potentially lasts a lifetime, the antithesis of fast fashion’s notorious processes and disposability. As the show unfolded, it became, in a way, a meditation on the timeless validity of Chanel’s principles: pale bouclé suits, attenuated in the skirt, puffed in the sleeve, and with set-away collars; a movement of classic navy and white (there was a lovely white-collared classic French Gigi-at-school dress); and passages of languid pearly charmeuse and black cocktailwear.But it was the evening that soared from the moment Lagerfeld started to introduce flecks of gold into the suiting. An incredible jacket and skirt made completely of gold and black geometric paillettes, a narrow streak of wonderment worn by Jamie Bochert, passed by, succeeded by airy lamé capes, a haze of gold and sparkle, floating from the shoulders of white pantsuits. It would take a much closer look to understand the technical wizardry and the actual degree of ecological soundness embedded in these clothes. That’s what clients will come to understand when they go up to the Rue Cambon for their fittings. It may be that they won’t be swayed one way or the other by the trouble Chanel took to source some of its materials this season.What surely matters at a time like this, even to the superrich, is whether these clothes have the built-in sustainability of another sort: Will they look just as beautiful and valid five or 10 years from now? Answer: Chosen well, yes. In another season, Karl and Chanel will doubtless have moved swiftly on from talking about ecology.

Alexander Wang,resort-2024-menswear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2024-menswear/alexander-wang,"Alexander Wang has entered his heritage brand era. The Rocco bag, first launched in 2009, is the comeback star of his latest collection. “When people started asking me for the Rocco again, I said, ‘are we really there yet? Are we back here?’” Wang recalled at a showroom visit. “I felt like it was just literally yesterday when I thought, ‘there’s too much Rocco,’ we need to purge.”As it turns out, Wang’s Rocco revival is coming right on schedule. Fashion conscious young people move fast and having embraced the Y2K trend, they’re now turning their attention to the 2010s, as the very online among us have noticed. “They weren’t around for the first round,” Wang continued. “They’re digging deeper into the depths of the internet. I couldn’t believe it, but I was getting texts from people asking me to make it again.” Where the original gave slouchy “model off-duty” vibes, the new one’s aerodynamism is born from the high frequency printing techniques used to make it.The early 2010s were Wang’s golden years, if that term can be used for a designer not yet 40. He had opened his first store in New York and had not yet been appointed as creative director at Balenciaga, and he was defining his design language—the deconstructed tailoring, the underwear as outerwear, and the leather and denim that gave his brand more street cred than any of his New York contemporaries.Those who witnessed Wang’s rise might shudder at the idea that his pre-Instagram collections qualify as vintage these days, but the designer himself is cheerily forward looking. He’s fresh off a listening tour in China where he’s opened about 15 stores in the last year. It was his first time in the country since the pandemic, and the feedback he kept hearing from customers was the need for versatility.That translated into Dickies-style chinos designed with hidden stretch waistbands so they can be worn high or low; and styling devices like boxer short tops that can be pulled on like a belt, to create the exposed underwear look without the bulk. For a bit of fun he designed a photo print of coins that appeared on an oversized shirt. Buttons on jean jackets and denim shirts also looked like honest-to-goodness nickels and dimes, though Wang clarified that they’re not actual U.S. currency.Wang’s store expansion is continuing apace in North America.

In the grand scheme of Italian culture, food has always been a more logical fit with film and fine art (Etro reminded us of Arcimboldo's 16th-century vegetable paintings) than with fashion. Not that logic is one of Kean Etro's lodestones, but he kind of showed why food and fashion are an odd couple, when one model walked by in a shirt and track pants printed with plates of seafood. Gamberoni are not glamorous. Bivalves are not beautiful. And tomato sauce embroideries only underscored the risk when the real thing meets white jeans on a summer holiday.Etro being something of a philosopher, there was the obvious subtext that you are what you eat. So if youwearwhat you eat, you're punching the point home even harder. The prints of pasta and shellfish were a trifle indigestible, especially when combined with Etro's swirling paisleys writ large, but the culture around enjoying food in the summer translated much more successfully into clothing. Blue- and red-checked tablecloths, for instance, were a cliché splendidly transmogrified into suits by the tailors Etro acknowledged so movingly on last season's catwalk. Gelato colors were celebrated in an uplifting sequence of separates. And you could say that the new emphasis on athleticwear was all about working off the last meal, as much as the generously cut double-breasted jackets and trousers would gracefully conceal any excess avoirdupois.A musical note: The live soundtrack was supplied by Hang Massive, an English duo encountered on the street in Goa by Kean and his wife, Constanza. They play hang drums, with a sound like a softer, sweeter steel drum and they're worth YouTubing. An Etro show is always an education on some level.",Tim Blanks,"June 22, 2014","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/55c6514308298d8be21e63b0/master/w_1280,c_limit/ETR_0039.1366x2048.JPG",,spring,2015,menswear,2010,Kean Etro,,,"Milan is already throwing up structures for next year 's Food Expo , so was hardly ahead of the curve in devoting his new collection to comestibles .

DKNY,resort-2012,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2012/dkny,"The sharply tailored cape that wears like a coat draped over the shoulders—a favorite way of dressing among fashion editors—was major for Fall at DKNY.

Scarf dressing, another well-trodden but resilient theme, was revisited here as well.

Kenzo,fall-2022-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2022-ready-to-wear/kenzo,"Pharrell Williams was here, wearing some cute diamond- and emerald-edged sunglasses he’d designed for Tiffany. Alongside him Kanye West and Julia Fox doubled up in double denim (hers by Daniel Roseberry at Schiap). Pusha T, Shygirl, J Balvin, Gunna, Big Matthew, Sik-k, and Tyler, the Creator were just down the row. This made for an extremely strong crowd at a Sunday morning show that effectively marked the end of this Omicron-quieted season of menswear and augured the unfolding of couture.In part, they were here for the house of Kenzo. All of them (and us) were seated in the beautiful but chilly (and suddenly weed-fumed) Galerie Vivienne. It was here in 1970 that a small gallery unit with cheap rent was snapped up by 31-year-old Kenzo Takada, who had arrived circuitously from Tokyo five years previously with the dream to emulate Yves Saint Laurent and become a fashion designer.Shortly after moving in and painting the interior after Rousseau, Kenzo threw his first show here under the name Jungle Jap (which he changed once discovering the pejorative weight of ‘Jap’ in the US). The collection was cut and sewn and painted with fabrics brought from a Montmartre market. As Kenzo later recalled: “I was looking for some kind of identity as an outsider, so I wanted to bring something very Japanese into it, and that meant textiles with a lot of color and pattern.” By 1993, when he sold his company for $80 million to what would become LVMH, Kenzo had developed that formula to become one of the most beloved and distinct designers operating in Paris. He sadly passed away in late 2020 after being laid low by Covid, but had continued to work on new projects— including a really excellent retrospective book of sketches and photography—until shortly before.Let’s be honest though: for the last few seasons there hasn’t been much buzz at Kenzo. Yes there was that period, starting a full decade ago, when the Kenzo-coded tigersweatshirtsproduced under the excellent Carol Lim and Humberto Leon went from cool to hot to way overcooked. But since their time here ended in 2019 the house has been quiet.What filled it with noise today was the arrival of new creative director Nigo. As excellently illustrated in the preview/profile yesterday here bySteff Yotka, Nigo’s creativity and clout—and of course his personal passion for and parallels with Kenzo—make him a serendipitously synchronized recruit for LVMH.

Marc Jacobs,fall-2019-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2019-ready-to-wear/marc-jacobs,"Marc Jacobs and his stylist Katie Grand made headlines last week when they helped Tomo Koizumi, a Japanese designer Grand discovered on Instagram, put on a show in the basement of Jacobs’s Madison Avenue pop-up store. Fashion loves beginnings, and this was a big one, stamped with not just the imprimatur of Jacobs and Grand, but also of hair and makeup stars Pat McGrath and Guido Palau, and the actress Gwendoline Christie, who took a catwalk turn. Tastemakers assembled, and Koizumi’s giant rainbow polyester organza poufs were the talk of the slow-to-heat-up New York collections.Fairy godparent duties over, it was Jacobs’s turn in the spotlight tonight. Though it’s been decades since his own beginning, he’s still essential viewing. The collection had prodigious volumes in common with Koizumi’s “ruffle armor.” The American designer has been exploring hyper-proportions for a couple of seasons now, via the 1980s silhouettes of Claude Montana and Yves Saint Laurent. Grand shapes were back again for Fall, but this time Jacobs was looking in the mirror, rather than at the couturiers of old. His repertoire is full of cloth coats and capes, of shredded tulle party dresses, of A-line skirts and crewnecks, of Prince of Wales pantsuits. Only here, in many cases, they were taken to extremes, the coats and capes pumped up with air, the dresses made more expressive with layers of crinolines. Stephen Jones–designed hats on nearly every model added inches to their stature.The feeling the show conjured was one of tenderness. It was partly the intimate setup—just 180 seats—and partly the models’ slow procession through the spotlit dark, but mostly it came down to that sense of the unfamiliar familiar, like déja vu, but different. When Christy Turlington, who walked in Jacobs’s seminal 1992 grunge show for Perry Ellis, glided out in an off-the-shoulder jet black frock embroidered all over with glossy feathers, murmurs of delight echoed down the rows. To see time pass is bittersweet. In hosting Koizumi, Jacobs made tacit acknowledgment of that. Last week, one of the many, many Instagrams that streamed through our feeds about Koizumi was an Oscars pitch. Call us old school.

Rick Owens,fall-2012-menswear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2012-menswear/rick-owens,"Rick Owens has mountains on his mind. He named today's show after them. And next week, Giorgio Pace Projects is launchingMagic Mountain, an exhibition of his furniture, in St. Moritz. A mountain makes an ideal Owens metaphor: aspiration, inspiration (you climb it 'cause it's there), one step closer to heaven. There's more. Mountains are sport, so there was an aerodynamic quality in a snow white shirt, with a collar that swooped back over the shoulder as if borne on a downhill wind. Maybe it was the thin mountain air that inspired the fragile aqua of another shirt. The stripes on small shearling jackets looked ski-ish. The white jersey pants they were paired with could also have been vintage skiwear at a pinch. And the final trio of padded, quilted coat, parka, and vest were clearly so down-filled as to resist the chill winds of Everest itself.If the abstract sportiness was a new mood for Owens, so was the Steerpike silhouette that matched high-waisted, baggy-crotched pants to cropped, high-waisted jackets with narrow sleeves that seemed to stretch the arms. There was something young andstreetabout the result, as opposed to the grand, ceremonial volumes that Owens specializes in. Of course,theywere here too, in the form of the skirts that have become a signature item.

Theory,fall-2020-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2020-ready-to-wear/theory,"In a game of word association,Theorywould be followed bysuitwithin about one second. The New York brand has long been known for its elevated, minimalist office uniforms, and as such, it’s mostly considered in the context of daywear. Theory suits became a thing in the ’90s, when it was still customary to go home and change before a night out, but chief brand officer Siddhartha Shukla knows women don’t have time for that in 2020. So he and his team challenged themselves to bring Theory into the evening, and quite literally cast their suits and separates in a darker light.Editors sat on speakers in a pitch-black gallery space in Chelsea, and when the lights flashed on, models were stomping out and ascending a rotating stage. As they arranged themselves in concentric circles, the thought briefly crossed your mind that someone might fall off, but these women weren’t in 9-to-5 pumps: Every look was grounded by a flat lug-sole boot, the best being a knee-high lace-up. Ultimately, this was an exercise in good styling. A prim leather shift dress was toned down by an oversized button-down, for instance, and another model wore a strapless wool LBD with those punkish tall boots. The strategy felt vaguely connected to what Theory’s former creative director, Francesco Fucci, proposed last season: reimagining “corporate” staples, but with a darker, grittier edge.That applied to both the women’s and men’s lines. For now, suits seem to be less of a focus on the guys’ side—they wore quarter-zip knits and sharp coats instead. But men’s and women’s fashion are in a constant dialogue these days; if the massive demand for women’s tailoring is any indication, there’s about to be a big market for cooler, more fashion-forward men’s suits.

Loewe,spring-2021-menswear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2021-menswear/loewe,"Fashion people have been bandying about terms like ‘experiential,’ ‘immersive,’ ‘multi-platform’ and ‘digital’ for years, but only now—in the midst of the horrendous crisis of the pandemic—have creative people started breaking through the walls of all that jargon. What Jonathan Anderson orchestrated on July 12th around the launch of Loewe’s spring 2021 collection and its women’s pre-collection felt like a long-needed quantum leap into the new world of open-ended possibilities. Where would a designer who’s always talked about Loewe as ‘a cultural brand’ and his links with artists and artisans go? How can the truth of tactility and emotion be felt when no congregational live event is possible?In a midday Zoom call, Anderson said that in the initial shock, he’d tussled with confronting how to carry on. “In the first two weeks of the lockdown, I hated being in the job I do. There’s been a couple of weeks where I’ve really struggled to know why I’m doing this; feeling powerless because you’re not saving lives, or because you’re part of a weird elite.” But then he rallied, “realizing you’re trying to save jobs through this, that there’s a whole ecosystem of families, people who’ve been making bags for generations.”On one level, what he came up with felt like dipping into a 24-hour Jonathan Anderson-curated worldwide live summer festival of arts, crafts, and conversations on Loewe’s Instagram page and website. “My whole thing is to do something in each time zone,” he said, from his London home, around 12PM British Standard Time. The program rolled from Beijing time onwards, connecting with (amongst others) crafts-collaborators Kayo Ando, who showed the art of Shibori, paper artist Shin Tanaka from Japan and the basketweave artist Idoia Cuesta in Galicia, Spain. There was music curated by Adam Bainbridge (aka Kindness), who showcased a calming ‘medley’ comprising different versions of Finnish musician Pekka Pohjola’sMadness Subsides, performed by Park Jiha in Korea, performer and producer Starchild, French-Malagasy pianist and bandleader Mathis Picard, and American harpist Ahya Simone.

Batsheva,resort-2019,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2019/batsheva,"Who said uniform dressing had to be minimalist? For designer Batsheva Hay, her uniform is a frilled and fun frock that she can wear all day long with anything from sneakers to heels. Hay’s own dress code is the inspiration for Batsheva, and in many ways this collection is really all about Hay’s own obsessions and life. She functions as her own fit model and designs for what she needs and wants, rather than imagining what some far-off woman might desire or what might pump up her sales. The method works because Hay is enmeshed into New York’s creative intelligentsia; her design process and desires are colored by those of the plugged-in and witty women around her.For Resort, Hay has expanded her offering ever so slightly. On one end are the even more fantastical pieces, like a minidress with heart-shaped pockets in a cherry red color or a moiré version of her signature ruffled silhouette in a rich raspberry color. On the other end of the spectrum are pieces that could appeal to those previously afraid of Batsheva’s big colors and bold shapes. Separates are a newish thing in this arena, like a cropped Victorian blouse or an easy full skirt. Hay has also introduced a longer silhouette that, while still trimmed with a ruffle at the hem and sleeves, is devoid of the girlishness that colors the rest of the collection. Dare I call it tough? With moto boots or a catty stiletto it certainly could be. There are also plenty of new accessories, from puffy headbands to bandanas to sarong-scarf hybrids, that will provide a point of entry to Hay’s world for new customers and a gotta-have-it piece for existing ones.Still, my hope for Hay is that she doesn’t get swept up in style numbers and bottom lines, and keeps her eponymous collection as more of a self-expressive art project than a full-blown fashion collection. Her own intuition is what makes Batsheva so singular in the market. Where else can you hear a designer talk about obsessively scrolling eBay and Etsy for vintage quilting fabrics and actually believe it? Perhaps her lookbook, shot in her mother-in-law’s artist studio with a certain maverick panache, is her own way of saying, “I’m an artist, too!” I believe it, and so should you.",Steff Yotka,"June 8, 2018","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b1a6da34c6bbc393b0c8907/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-batsheva-vogue-resort-2019-pr.jpg",,resort,2019,other,2010,,,,"Who said uniform dressing had to be minimalist ?

Baja East,resort-2016,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2016/baja-east,"There's no doubt that the fashion establishment is at long last opening its eyes to the potential of a post-gender approach. Look no further than Selfridges' recently debuted unisex department or transgender model/It girl Hari Nef, who just signed with IMG. But where some brands undertake dressing across X and Y chromosomes with an avant-garde, editorial flair, Baja East is an ambisexual brand that's making a bid for the American luxury market. Designers Scott Studenberg and John Targon aren't just turning out hyper-luxe ponchos for urban nomads and surfer girls. They're also designing for clients who shop at stores like Bergdorf Goodman, where in a couple of weeks Baja East will make its debut with Pre-Fall, sitting alongside such labels as Bottega Veneta and The Row. While Baja East is less than two years old, Resort marked one of its most persuasive outings to date.For starters, there was a new lookbook format, in which male and female models wore many of the same garments side by side, illustrating the real-world styling possibilities for both sexes of the label's cropped skater shorts, harem pants, and wrap-style bandeau tops. The tenor of luxury was high throughout the collection, particularly when it came to the soft cashmere robes in Baja's signature tonal ""ikat graffiti"" print. Creating pieces like that was a savvy move from the designers (who cut their teeth in sales at several top houses), since Resort deliveries will be hitting stores just in time for holiday shopping. The customer who has the disposable income to gift one of those items probably has an evening event or two in her iCal, so Studenberg and Targon explored the possibilities of dressier fare, like a louche white jumpsuit in double-face crepe-silk. Elsewhere a citron jungle-print techno jacquard sprung to life in slouchy trousers (notably not of the pull-on sort) and a sleeveless trench. And dressing for wintertime bashes will be a chic, simple feat thanks to a ribbed turtleneck maxi dress that contained the subtlest hint of Lurex—enough, as the boys pointed out, to wink with the inevitable pop of a camera flash.",Kristin Anderson,"June 3, 2015","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/55c650b808298d8be214f5dd/master/w_1280,c_limit/baja-east-001-1366.jpg",,resort,2016,other,2010,,,,"There 's no doubt that the fashion establishment is at long last opening its eyes to the potential of a post - gender approach .

Marchesa Notte,spring-2019-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2019-ready-to-wear/marchesa-notte,"Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig took both of their Marchesa collections—the couture line and its little sister, Notte—out of the photo studio this season for the first time. They shot the dresses on the grounds of a massive estate surrounded by a lush, seemingly endless forest, so the photos look like they’ve been plucked from a fairy tale. While Marchesa’s couture gowns were mostly captured among the massive, ivy-covered trees, the Notte lineup was photographed against the ornate stone walls, marble pillars, and crumbling mosaics of the estate—perhaps to balance out the sweetness of the dresses. Watercolor florals, ruffled sleeves, giant bows, and ornate embroideries lent a youthful tone to the Notte collection, particularly the dresses in soft candy shades.It made sense to see the clothes in a natural setting, given Chapman and Craig’s loose inspiration: “serene, blooming meadows” and overgrown gardens.

Blumarine,spring-2024-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2024-ready-to-wear/blumarine,"Blumarine’s show space today was an immaculate white box. Gone were the mounds of sand and blazing pyres of the Joan of Arc collection, or the dark underworld where livid mermaids were circling around heaps of broken shells. Or the red Lamborghini smacked in the middle of a catwalk surrounded by sashaying skimpy pink Barbies that were “resurrected from their dusty boxes,” as Nicola Brognano put it. Had Blumarine mutated its genes and gone minimal? “No,” was his answer. “I just felt it was time for more light, more lightness, more butterflies.”Butterflies, which in a previous collection were emblazoned on a sold-out skimpy top that was a TikTok sensations, came out in force this season, together with a parade of feathered wings à la Victoria’s Secret, making the case for Blumarine’s Lightness of Being new course. Butterflies are synonymous with frivolity. And angels, well, they’re angels. Blumarine’s were languid, lanky, handsome winged Adonises strutting down the catwalk in low-rise gold-leather trousers from which emerged smooth, naked torsos dusted with glitter—you couldn’t take the eyes off them, so lightness of thought wasn’t an option here. As for the butterflies, they seemed to have lost their impalpable, fluttering innocence, rendered as they were into heavily sequined thongs, barely covering the no-fly zone. “They’re pussy butterflies,” joked Brognano. To emphasize the concept, butterfly-shaped tiny rubber bags were part of a collaboration with a label (aptly) called For Bitches. And to make the waters even murkier, models walked to the beat of The Idol’s Lily-Rose Depp’sWorld Class Sinner/I’m A Freak.Brognano’s (rather peculiar) idea of purity and airy luminosity expanded into other literal translations: colors were pale, jerseys were flimsy like hosiery, ribbons and trains trailed breezily on the back of ultra-short sexy numbers; shiny gold leather lit up pedal pushers and corsets. Bustiers and pencil skirts in clear PVC, studded with an abundance of rhinestones and crystals, were the pinnacle of Blumarine’s ode to lightness—or better said, nakedness.

Lacoste,fall-2016-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/lacoste,"Reviving a sports-based heritage brand is never a walk in the park, nor should it be. It should be ruddier, likeLacoste’s collection today, an exercise in trim tactility and fit minimalism. Which is to say, creative director of almost six years Felipe Oliveira Baptista is settling into the role like a natural. During an editors’ preview a day earlier, he referenced the French Ski Team and old-school Atari graphics that he morphed into pixelated skiers and snowmen. Playful, uplifting, and naïf, in other words. Or, as musical director Michel Gaubert described his soundtrack, “a modernist ski chalet that turns into a disco.”Like last season—which saw a revisit of the house’s Olympic history to great, abstract effect—for Fall, the designer again mined the archives, which now spans 80 years. The retro-rich tone was set in the first exit, a slick women’s PVC poncho and track pants (although, as the designer pointed out, the side stripe was in fact three distinct stripes—no skimping here), followed by a psychedelic blue wood-grain padded suit. Long shearling overcoats—some reversible—had bisecting zippers at the waist, while color-blocked snug sweaters came with zip-attached gloves. The Lacoste headband, too, was shown with an attachment, a scarf that wrapped around the face to create a high collar.The snowy ’70s vibe—appropriate on this freakishly frigid day, with temps dipping into the single digits—continued with velvet track suits, moleskin culottes, streamlined turtlenecks, and a knit poncho dress with more of those pixelated figures skiing down the front, as well as thigh-high patent boots and huggable padded bags. The classic polo shirt, with which the brand has long been synonymous, made a single yet dramatic appearance in bright orange PVC and paired with a matching flared skirt. Lacoste's ’70s advertising also got the wink-nudge treatment. Everyone gets the “un crocodile” reference, but what about the feminine, “une crocodelle,” which Baptista spelled across a pink sweater?

Balenciaga,pre-fall-2024,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2024/balenciaga,"For out-of-towners, Los Angeles has the quality of the surreal. The palm trees, canyons, and golden light, the Facetuned faces and super-toned bodies, the cult of Erewhon, the Hollywood sign. Demna, Balenciaga’s Georgian creative director, is not immune to its allure. After his pre-fall show in LA today, he called it “my favorite city in the world,” saying, “all my cultural evolution, when I was a teenager growing up in this kind of post-Soviet vacuum, it really came from here, through movies, music—I mean, everything that I kind of absorbed, that later on started to kind of become my fashion references.”There was certainly something surreal about Balenciaga’s gothy black clad guests turning up en masse on a well manicured stretch of Windsor Boulevard in Hancock Park, with that famous Hollywood sign presiding in the distance. “It feels like we’re going to a funeral in sunny Transylvania,” a fellow editor cracked. Or like stepping into a Tim Burton movie shot in Technicolor.This was the brand’s second destination show in the US. Last year, Demna chose the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to present Balenciaga’s “Garde-Robe,” collection of “upscale classic garments” with an emphasis on tailoring, one of his specialties. This collection skewed more SoCal, starting with the exercise clothes, gym bags, and souped-up sneakers of the first few looks. The circa Y2K velour jumpsuits and giant high-heeled shearling boots that came next will be familiar to readers ofUS Magazine, which would’ve been another way the young Demna got his celebrity content, unless it was the famous Steven Meisel Hollywood shoot inVogueItalia that did it for him.Back in those pre-social media days, the paparazzi lurked outside the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Circa 2023, it’s Erewhon smoothies that the stars are clutching. Timed to today’s event, Balenciaga collaborated with the LA grocer on a juice. Made in part with activated charcoal powder, it’s as black as the stretchy turtleneck and tight jeans worn in the show by Brigitte Nielsen, taking over the actress-moonlighting-as-model role from Isabelle Huppert. “I don’t know what’s in it,” Demna said. “I just wanted it to be black.”Wellness culture is one of LA’s most successful exports. The show’s powerful soundtrack, made as usual by Demna’s partner BFRND, poked not so subtle fun at its presumptive hollowness. Demna rejected the idea that he approached the collection—or LA itself—with irony, but there’s something comically perverse about a paper grocery bag made in leather.The sensational evening clothes—some perhaps headed to tomorrow night’s Academy Museum Gala down the road—were as Hollywood as the rest of the show, but it was easier to read earnestness in their elegance and drama. There was a respectful nod to Cristobal Balenciaga in the grand volumes of a white wedding gown whose funnel neck extended to just below the model’s eyes. Two other dresses conjured post-coital bed sheets tied at the bust, if bed sheets came in patent leather. These were pure Demna, and you could make a connection between them and the trash-bag bag he designed for fall 2022, the show that took place days after the start of the Ukraine war.We were in one of LA’s prettiest enclaves today, but Demna’s not blind to the city’s extreme inequalities.

Yves Saint Laurent,resort-2020,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2020/saint-laurent,"This past June, Anthony Vaccarello showed his men’s Spring 2020 Saint Laurent collection—and a smattering of women’s looks from his 2020 Resort—on a boardwalk (of ebonized wood, very YSL) that snaked down a Malibu beach. There was a pulsating soundtrack and a major A-list-y celeb front row, but both kind of recede into the memory when you consider Vaccarello had the West Coast sky sliding into night and the waves crashing against the shoreline as his backdrop.Vaccarello said he had been thinking about how Morocco’s glittering hippie/boho enclaves of the late ’60s and early ’70s (also very YSL) are mirrored by the live-by-your-own-free-spirited-rules of latter-day California. It’s a pretty spot-on comparison. After all, where else resides that sense of being able to simultaneously lose yourselfandfind yourself?For him, that duality might also be striking a little closer to home; to Paris, specifically Vaccarello’s Left Bank design atelier. There was a distinct new comfort level to the men’s collection, literally and metaphorically; the terrific djellaba-like tunic-shirts and voluminous tapering pressed-pleat pants, a sure sign of his growing confidence with menswear. When it comes to the women’s looks—seen in greater numbers a few weeks ago at a viewing of the 2020 Resort—it’s obviously different. Vaccarello has been designing accomplished (and provocative) womenswear for a decade and more. His Saint Laurent women’s shows have been pyrotechnic showstoppers, with some audacious ideas—neon in black light; monumental sculptural feathers—which have been brand (and Instagram) dynamite.Yet away from the main stage, Resort makes it clear that Vaccarello is getting very comfortable in going full steam ahead on a YSL that’s about everyday life. (Look, I know the term is all relative, and after seeing the Resort, who wouldn’t want to have the kind of fabled, escapist day-to-day these clothes exude?) If Saint Laurent the man designed plenty of the building blocks of the modern wardrobe—the tuxedo, the blouse, the trench—then Vaccarello is retooling them his way. From Resort that might mean a black velvet smoking jacket with gilded edges, worn with a long black leather skirt that has as much snap as the fastenings running down its front, or a jet and gold sequin lace camisole with white jeans.An ivory silk tie-front shirt worn with yet more of those press-pleated pants riffed on Monsieur Saint Laurent’s own North African uniform back in the day. Ditto the vest traced with swirls of embroidery over a silk shirt where polka dots were formed out of a constellation of golden pinheads. These were worn with jeans that grazed the ankles, the better to show off new tortoiseshell-effect leather oxfords, or, possibly, ribbon-strap thong sandals.

Elie Saab,spring-2021-couture,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2021-couture/elie-saab,"In feathers and beads, tulle and lace, Elie Saab let his imagination take flight for spring. The very existence of this collection is something of a wonder itself. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, artisans had to work in shifts to complete it. On top of that, Saab’s home of Beirut is still dealing with the aftereffects of the terrible explosion there. Anyone else might have been rattled, but the designer seems to be taking things in stride, reminding this reviewer that he started his career in 1982, during the Siege of Beirut.Faced with such upheaval, Saab created an escapist fantasy calledLe Théâtre du Rêve(Theater of the Dream). Models wore marvelously worked pieces with Belle Époque splendor. On top of that, some looks were accessorized with glittering and plumed headdresses that added an aspect of showgirl glamour to the proceedings. Many pieces featured bold, architectural shoulder details. When combined with the volumes and Saab’s new use of feathers, they read as wings. Dresses predominated, but there were pant looks as well, and the thigh-high boots paired with shorter hems could be mistaken for leggings.By limiting his palette to white, mauve, and black, Saab kept the silhouettes and embellishments in focus. The designer said he wanted to create something spectacular and signature, and for the most part he did. Hooded capes, including a pink one with sheer embroidered insets, seemed destined for very grown-up and sophisticated fairy-tale heroines.Speaking about once upon a times, the collection film opens with a small boy who stares at the sky and escapes to the land of imagination. It seems he’s a stand-in for a young Saab. “I tried to remember my childhood,” he explained. “With this virus and all that has happened in Lebanon, I believe we go back to the roots, for the memories.”With the exception of the dreaming-boy conceit, this wasn’t a time-traveling collection but an escapist one, where dreams for the future can be entertained. Ultimately it was about hope through beauty. And while Saab clearly had his customers in mind, he was also thinking of a higher purpose. “I’d like if you can say that what I present is also always for my country and for…all the children, for the younger generation, to give them a place, a dream,” he stated. “I believe when we present something beautiful, it affects our country and our people a lot, allowing them to feel like there are always beautiful things that survive.”",Laird Borrelli-Persson,"February 20, 2021","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/602e5aa2fd5c2f01bddaf3ec/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-Elie-Saab-Couture-spring-21.jpg",,spring,2021,couture,2020,Elie Saab,1964.0,,"In feathers and beads , and lace , let his imagination take flight for spring .

Nanette Lepore,fall-2014-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2014-ready-to-wear/nanette-lepore,"""It's an interweaving of different embellishments and embroideries from all over. I just sort of picked my favorites and brought them back to New York City to be handcrafted here,"" said Nanette Lepore backstage before her Fall runway show. The #HandCraftedInNY theme (guests were encouraged to share that hashtag on social media) tied in nicely with the designer's longstanding commitment to preserving the city's Garment District. She recently met with Mayor Bill de Blasio to discuss the cause, and outfitted his wife and daughter for his inauguration back in January.Lepore opened with a group of looks in purple—the color of more like half the lineup—that ranged from deep shades of bordeaux and cassis to shocking magenta and violet. Perhaps the colorway was a tribute to her daughter Violet on her sixteenth birthday. Addressing her youthful customer's everyday needs, Lepore offered office-appropriate suiting separates such as a sharp, pleated jacket styled with a waist-defining belt. On the more playful, weekend-ready side of the equation were boldly feminine dresses including a bohemian, ""handloom"" patterned style that looked cool topped with a fuzzy mohair cardigan. Meanwhile, a Lurex-flecked turtleneck paired with a densely embroidered midi skirt highlighted the collection's artisanal feel, as did the gray flannel finale number, which was intricately embellished with a magpie assortment of sequins and beads.""I like the idea that you can start the season with long ditzy skirts and dresses, and then start piling on alpaca sweaters and very utilitarian coats,"" said Lepore. Noteworthy outerwear items included a tailored, menswear-ish topper with an iridescent sheen, as well as a variety of shearling-trimmed coats; the fur occasionally seemed a bit too hairy, like it needed a trim.

Andrew Gn,fall-2019-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2019-ready-to-wear/andrew-gn,"Andrew Gn’s couture approach to ready-to-wear (not to mention his expansive personality) has endeared him to society ladies for years now. This season, he surprised them by switching tack, dialing back on the surface embellishments he’s known for in favor of fabric development and construction.The result was one of his strongest shows in recent memory. The designer said that the ’60s dramaThe World of Suzy Wong, which he saw again recently after first watching it as a kid, had stuck with him. “I always thought there was something different about the star, Nancy Kwan,” said Gn. He later learned that her father was Chinese and her mother was Scottish. Soon after, he came across a still of Grace Kelly wearing a traditional cheongsam, and it clicked. “It’s very covered up, but for me the cheongsam is the sexiest dress the Chinese ever created,” he said.Gn and his atelier dove deep into construction techniques, developing python and zebra jacquard or snakeskin lace and using them as panels, inserts, and overlays with cut velvet jacquard and taffeta. An early geometric jacquard coat with feather sleeves signaled this new direction, and that initial black-and-white series flowed into a masterful exercise in color blocking. (Said Gn after the show: “I am a colorist. I don’t wear a lot, but I love it.”) Emerald green snake appliqués on sharply tailored coats and jackets were another striking departure. Toward the end, the designer pushed the cheongsam idea into a trapeze dress embroidered with silver stars and rhinestones that is probably already packed up and on its way to a red carpet somewhere.Other groupings hewed more to familiar signatures, such as butterfly frogging on a flounce-sleeved top with a mandarin collar, and a royal blue coat or a white crepe dress. The guipure dresses with 3-D appliqués were also classic Gn. Elsewhere, he transposed a chrysanthemum motif from a Japanese Meiji period vase onto a series of dresses, most strikingly on a chartreuse midi with hand-braided fringe.Those kinds of special, limited-series pieces are something Gn’s core customer counts on. Now that he has his e-commerce business squared, Gn is building out his business incrementally both online and off. He’s in talks to open a store in Hong Kong early next year, but in the meantime, he says, he’s finding pop-ups an ideal way to connect personally with his base.

We were in Paris for a start, in the Lycée Carnot, where Chloé, Valentino, Paul Smith, and a zillion others had trod before. Some of the crossover crowd drifting fresh—damn them—into town for couture were here to check it out, too. What would we see?Weston pulled on the hand brake, burned some rubber, and squealed Dunhill fresh into a new (but not entirely) era following the considered, delicate reign of John Ray. Dunhill started as a motoring accessories brand, and in the late ’70s and early ’80s was a prime exemplar of shades of brown masculinity: the Rollagas lighters, the big lapelled luxury tailoring, and the fragrances—ah, Edition.Tonight Weston tried to echo but update that alpha male vibe. His triumph was the outerwear, which, given his long spell at Burberry, was probably not a surprise. Boldly silhouetted drill and moleskin topcoats were a little bit harder and in-your-face than the soft-shouldered check Italian numbers everyone has been wearing at the shows, but they looked deeply put-on-able: fresh. Personally, I thought the delicately kicked leather pants were way too overemphasized for a luxury marque that deals primarily with businessmen—just check out the gents at Bourdon House in London—but they did nicely preface the very beautiful webbed bags in bordeaux and black, and the oversize leather zipped blousons. The narrowly quilted leather jacket inspired by ’70s car upholstery was awesome. And the Dunhill selvage strips run into the arms and legs of a cool check track top and pant in the first look made for a really excellent mishmash of then and now.This collection veered not entirely convincingly hither and thither in search of a new Dunhill man, as if guided by a satnav with only periodic connection.

The past few collections indicate that Wingate is on track to steer the 35-year-old brand into the future. Here, the most successful looks were pared down. Sharp suiting separates in on-trend powder pink and a matching topcoat had an ageless appeal, while a tan leather T-shirt-and-pencil-skirt set also seemed fresh, particularly when styled with a sleek chrome belt.

But its ambitious new CEO, Frédéric de Narp, has other plans. Bally is to be a lifestyle brand, which means shoes need accessories of their own above the ankles. Herz and Fidler have not been replaced, but the Bally design team worked in conjunction with the young French designer Alexandre Mattiussi of Ami to restart ready-to-wear.

After the colorful spring show, the palette here was concise, scaled down to bright red, black, white and, this being Max Mara, a profusion of camel. (Griffiths wittily refers to Reggio Emilia, where the company’s headquarters are located, as Camelandia). Pieces were easy and sassy, with a young spirit and “a bit of razzmatazz to indulge yourself.” Stripes, polka dots, stars, and leopard spots made for eye-catching graphics that graced pareo miniskirts worn with tucked-in blazer bodysuits, leggy all-in-ones, and pretty panier shorts paired with flared-peplum, bell-sleeved tailored jackets.A Max Mara collection cannot miss a belted trench coat; the updated pre-fall version was in a soft caramel shade, cut slightly oversized with contrasting cable-knitted sleeves. Another new shape was a biker jacket elongated into a city coat zippered sideways; on a similar note, a short double-breasted black coat was made in see-through techno mesh.

The signatures Choi has established—easy-to-wear, adaptable office-suitable style, buttons as decoration, pieces that can be wrapped and tied—all spring from the sensibility of a Korean who went through the British fashion education system and has shown in London for a decade.Underlying all that is the fact that his prices are reasonable, and the as-seen-on-Instagram looks are commercially appealing in a way that is inclusive of different shapes and sizes. Choi was a menswear tailor before he found his womenswear groove—once you know that, you see why he can pull off collarless, gold-buttoned, wrap-over blazers and coats and make them work variously with kick-flares and tailored shorts.

With Faces-era Rod Stewart croaking over the sound system, the connection with a vintage Gucci moment was inescapable.But Giannini has found her strength in that connection.

Funny thing though—as excessive as that menagerie may sound, it played as quite easy, even restrained, due to the muted colors and casual attitude.

For the first time, he marshaled a collection that was completely together, stamped with distinct and confident personality—a love of whimsy in a young but couture-ish idiom—and underpinned by attentively serviced sponsorship deals. He'd talked Taroni silks into providing lushly colored lengths of double duchesse, and he'd worked on lime, purple, acid yellow, and orange prints that ""looked blurry, like a landscape speeding past when you're on a train."" The fabrics turned into short dresses with dance skirts, covered-up cocktail suits with flat bows detailing stand-up necklines and belts, and dramatic strapless gowns—pieces made all the more outstanding with over-embroidery and padding (hand-done by Jenny King, a friend in Brighton), and scattered chunks of asymmetric gumdrop-colored Swarovski crystals.Worked in, too, was cream lace from the French manufacturer Sophie Halette (a long-standing relationship) and raincoats representing Erdem's continuing consultancy with Mackintosh (trenchcoatswithlace in two cases).

Jonathan Saunders,fall-2013-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2013-ready-to-wear/jonathan-saunders,"""Did you like the show?"" Jonathan Saunders asked Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood when he came backstage after Saunders' show tonight. ""A lot of tits,"" Wood replied roguishly. He wasn't wrong. The designer's latest collection celebrated the pneumatic uplift of British pinups of the fifties, with bosoms cupped in bustiers, pushed skyward by corsetry or hinted at in the kind of oversize knitwear that once would have left no illusions as to why well-endowed starlets were called sweater girls. But if, in hindsight, there was something almost wholesome about the brassy sass of a blond bombshell like Diana Dors, Saunders injected enough kink to make you think of David Lynch. The director was a reference point he was quite partial to.After last season's stripey metallic chill, Saunders had found himself drawn to warm and woolly for winter. But that was just too literal for him, so in came the vinyl and the rubber, to add edge to the mohair fuzzies. And that contradictory combination of elements was at the heart of his collection. Still, for all the implied raciness of the inspiration, there was something curiously old-fashioned about it. You could imagine rock 'n' rollin' suburbanites in the fifties pairing a mohair sweater and a vinyl circle skirt for a swingers' night out. Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood tapped into that fetish underground for their legendary King's Road stores, though that was nearly 40 years ago, and the frisson is long faded. But the necklines, the silhouettes, and the color palette (mustard, rust, baby pink, sky blue) in today's show had a late-fifties/early-sixties flavor. So did the hairdos. Saunders had even lifted the key visual motif—a scrolly, leafy thing—from an old bra. It was laser-cut and hand-embroidered onto anything from a strappy wool dress to a sheer black slip.Though Saunders is a past master of the outré, he has never been someone you would consider a retroactive designer.

Zimmermann,spring-2017-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-ready-to-wear/zimmermann,"“I grew up in the suburbs of Sydney,” said Zimmermann’s Nicky Zimmermann today. “About 45 minutes out of the city—you were kind of deprived of access to the subculture happening in town. So, every Saturday, I’d drive in with my friends and we’d make our own outfits.” This origin story served as the inspiration for Zimmermann’s Spring collection, which demonstrated an improvement over this past Fall—perhaps because its underlying idea was so close to Nicky’s heart. There’s nothing quite like hitting up the city as a youngster when your day-to-day life in suburbia is a little slow (this writer can relate).What that morphed into on the runway was clothing that had a ruffled pomp with a polished, DIY kind of indifference, rife with lace, tulle, layers, prints, and detail. What’s regularly remarkable about Zimmermann is the brand’s ability to produce high-quality, intricate workmanship while retailing at a sub-designer price point. One piece, a white lace and purply floral menagerie of wraps and tiers (essentially a souped-up prairie dress), was especially striking in terms of its construction. It also featured an off-the-shoulder element, which is proving to be quite trendy in the early stages of NYFW.Zimmermann mentioned that the overall feel of the collection was also “kind of sexy pirate,” a descriptor that must have sprung from the “romanticism” of her youthful memories. Sometimes that manifestation looked a little derivative of, say, Rodarte, but it wasn’t bothersome. One standout item was a pajama pant in windowpane check that had weighty silver buttons running up the sides. “It’s about the fun we were having,” concluded the designer.

Moschino,spring-2022-menswear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2022-menswear/moschino,"A ladylike hamburger skirt suit? A hotdog dress with a boule cape for bread? A chocolate sundae bustier with a fishtail skirt and a cherry hat on top? For pre? “Sometimes I forget that maybe I might be a little twisted, because it’s all so natural,” Jeremy Scott laughed, talking about his Moschino resort and men’s collections on a video call from Los Angeles. “It’s enthusiastic, it’s genuine, it’s pure. It’s maybe a little bit naïve. It sounds stupid to say that about oneself, but if I think about it in terms of everyone else… Yeah! It’s a pre-collection and I have a motherfucking hotdog dress!”The inspired films that Scott has created for Moschino during the lockdown period may have been escapist, but that sensibility has always underpinned his work. Through the crisis, Scott evaded direct references to mid- and post-pandemic dressing, drawing instead on the power of optimism to see him—and us—through. There was, however, an irony to the way he elevated symbols of mundanity in this collection, which felt so symptomatic of our moment in time, when the idea of dropping into a diner or going out for a hotdog—those mid-century postcards of American lifestyle—seemed positively exotic.For Scott, life is a musical, or at least it should be. After last season’s museum spectacular, Jungle Red, he wanted to work more with Karen Elson. Following Radio Redhead, Vol. 1, the cover album she released in December, she had asked Scott what covers he thought she should record for a potential volume two. Those conversations inspired Lightning Strikes, the all-American tribute to classic musicals that framed the Moschino resort and men’s collections, and culminated in a performance of the original song of the same title, which Elson recorded for an upcoming record of her own material.The film, which was shot on the Universal Studios lot, stars Elson as a waitress, who dreams herself away from the hustle and bustle of her diner shift, with patrons, cooks, and fellow waitresses transforming into her backup dancers. She sings a cover of Chic’s “Everybody Dance” before she hits the street to an interpretation of “Funkytown” by Lipps Inc (with a 50-person dance sequence), and finally makes it to a theater where a pinball-themed performance crescendos into a music video for “Lightning Strikes.” “And then it was all a dream, like any good Hollywood movie!” Scott said.",Anders Christian Madsen,"June 29, 2021","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/60d9faa0e730eaa9fc0e42b5/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-Moschino-Resort-22-And-Mens-Spring-22.jpg",,spring,2022,menswear,2020,Jeremy Scott,1975.0,Pratt Institute,"A ladylike hamburger skirt suit ?

Nina Ricci,fall-2019-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2019-ready-to-wear/nina-ricci,"Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh were a surprise appointment at Nina Ricci. The couple, in work and in life, have a young menswear label, Botter, whose oversize tailoring and energetic humor caught the attention of the fashion world last year. They were LVMH Prize finalists and picked up the top design award at the Festival d’Hyères. They’ve never designed womenswear. Nina Ricci is a historic house with the most feminine of aesthetics. As a couturier, Ricci didn’t have the distinctive design signature of contemporaries like Cristóbal Balenciaga, Coco Chanel, or Madame Grès, but her perfume, L’Air du Temps, is one of the most famous going.“They gave us a blank page,” said Herrebrugh at a preview. Not unpredictably, their debut leaned heavily toward tailoring. With an eye to couture shapes, they planted a big bow at one shoulder of a double-breasted boxy jacket and swaddled others with demonstrative wraps. The designers proved they have a contrarian streak: The maillot shapes that they superimposed on the bodies of coats and blazers were, they said, a riff on the traditional corsets found in Nina Ricci tailleurs of old. The results weren’t quite as elegant as they probably hoped, but one exercise that worked well was the patternmaking they did using a parasol. Opened and laid flat, it provided the template for the twisting shape of the show-opening blouse, which was as light and airy as what is expected at Nina Ricci. The hats, sort of like oversize cloches perched high on the head, were modeled on the cap at the tip of the parasol.The designers came at the trademark Ricci lightness a couple of other ways. One was to use lawn-chair mesh for several pieces, including a dress and skirt layered over trousers—the oversize grommets and thick cording were the giveaways. Their other idea was to reproduce Bubble Wrap in organza; small and large squares of the bubbles decorated two-dimensional dresses. “It was quite a lot of research,” Herrebrugh said.

Victoria Beckham,fall-2019-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2019-ready-to-wear/victoria-beckham,"How much do designers calculate the psychological effect of color on us? In a season when spirits have gotten more than a little ground down (to put it mildly) by the sight of drab grays and browns set against an even gloomier political backdrop, Victoria Beckham’s first look—a white windowpane-checked skirt suit, and red blouse, worn with zingy scarlet stretch-leather spike-heeled boots—was an instant mood-lifter. That vibrant red—let’s call it VB vermillion—must do well for her, because it was scattered through her Spring collection, not to mention liberally repped by audience members.Here, for Fall, it popped up again, threaded through her proposal for pepping up the season in a collection she called “an A-Z of a woman’s life. She’s a lady, but she’s not ladylike. She’s proper, but she’s not prim.”Since she’s come back to show on home ground in London, there’s been something less clinical, more approachable about what Beckham does with her ready-to-wear. It hardly warrants a conceptual narrative to interpret this: She puts together flattering shapes and combinations of color which are persuasively easy to wear—and all the more persuasive if she wears them herself, because there are millions of women and girls who hang on her every press appearance and Instagram story. The high-waisted flared pants in this collection got their introduction to her public in early January, when the Beckhamfamillemade their way to a breakfast sortie at the Kent & Curwen menswear show that David is involved with.It’s fair betting that the direction of this whole collection sprang from the popular feedback from that VB trouser teaser. Seventies flares led to bourgeois chain prints, pencil skirts, tiny argyle sweaters, and big pointed shirt collars as sure as night follows day.

In between—and in the soundscape—we had Erdem Moralioglu’s extended tribute to Maria Callas, her greatness, her status, and style “almost as a pop idol of the ’50s,” as he put it, and her unraveling as a tragic recluse, undone by the betrayal of the love of her life.His deep exploration of the life of Callas, on- and offstage, began with his precollection—research on her performances and dramatic costumes around the centenary of her birth in 2023. The complex psychologies of extraordinary women of the past have always been the fuel for Moralioglu’s layered design approach; the plots always blending into his own design narrative: a romantic, flowered, maybe raw-edged recasting of formal social-occasion dress codes.Callas’s wardrobe—the tiny-waisted, full-skirted dresses; draped scarf necklines; swing coats—the midcentury-modern textile art involved in opera productions, and the idea of glamorous marabou feathers gone a bit mad set Moralioglu off. “I was fascinated by the push and pull between person and persona,” he said. Carmine red dresses, roses attached to the toes of slingbacks, as if thrown at her feet onstage, and then satin pajamas and shoes evoking marabou slippers hinted at that story line.Then you could pan out from the clothes and take in the fact that the show was held beneath the Parthenon statues at the British Museum. The antiquities by the fifth- century sculptor and architect Phidias were renamed by the British as the Elgin Marbles from the time they were removed from Athens and shipped to the UK by the agents of the British 7th Earl of Elgin in the early 19th century. Their rightful cultural ownership has been an official matter of contention between Greece, the museum, and the British government since 1983. The long, drawn-out negotiations between the Greek and British governments for their return, or at least a loan, to the Acropolis museum made headlines last November in yet another diplomatic stand-off.Moralioglu was definitely thinking about Callas’s Greekness when he sought permission to show there: “Specifically, I really studied a specific performance she did in 1953 ofMedea.” That Euripides tragedy was the ancient link, but there was more. Callas was born in New York, trained in Greece, and made her name on the world stage. “I wanted to show in this space that epitomized her Greekness,” he said, adding, “I was interested in the idea of someone starting off somewhere and ending up somewhere else.”Was he hinting about a resonance in his own life story as the Canadian-born son of an English mother and Turkish father who settled in London? Perhaps. He also made a final remark to the press that he had been moved by a photograph of Callas’s ashes, draped in the Greek flag, before they were interred in Greece.

This writer didn’t catch anyone putting the mini notebook to use; but then, only a few of us have a duty to do so. What follows are mine.As with every season, Yamamoto gave his audience much to contemplate—and ultimately, to wear. The first and largest grouping of looks featured ensembles assembled largely through rows of buttons rather than draping. We often take for granted the gray area between a piece of clothing being on or off, open or closed; but Yamamoto’s ideas are never black or white, even if they present exactly that way on the surface. Asked what he wanted to say with the technique, he replied, “Each customer can play with each silhouette; it’s a natural change.” And to illustrate, he asked permission to unbutton my jacket, re-buttoning it irregularly. Note to self: very cool. “See, you have this strange new mood; it’s very easy, but it’s still very serious.”The serious part was telling. For some time, the music that accompanies the collection has been just Yamamoto and his guitar. For this show, he sung most of the words in French. “I wanted to create dark, heavy music, so in this case, English sounded too light,” he explained. Whatever emotion people felt, the clothes were certainly not heavy. Yamamoto relied primarily on cotton—washed toile and poplin—instead of the usual gabardine, and introduced a suite of fine-gauge knits, their sheer effect more sensual than usual. Further on, the complex creations gave way to more reduced, more exposed designs. These were the most beautiful dresses of the lot, yet to Yamamoto, they represented the predicament of the present. “It’s this crazy global warming, you know. But I don’t want girls to show too much of their body, just the back,” he said before revealing that the stickers on their skin were rather racy. One read,Love Yohji Sex.The fact that he noted “people are suffering” without claiming his clothes would solve this felt honest, if nothing more. And there was something about the bustled looks toward the end that suggested he was just as content looking back as forward. Still, the multitude of shoes offered some sort of metaphorical path: wedge sandals, tennis shoes, futuristic sneakers, derbies, desert boots, open-toed oxfords; each shifted the reading of the looks, from feminine to intellectual to survivalist. They reaffirmed that Yamamoto’s approach befits a wide swath of women—far more than we give him credit for.",Amy Verner,"September 29, 2017","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59cebd3ae4243e55c9af8c2c/master/w_1280,c_limit/_MON0037.jpg",,spring,2018,ready-to-wear,2010,Yohji Yamamoto,1943.0,Bunka Fashion College,"The invitation for the show came wrapped around a booklet of sticky notes , as though the designer was encouraging guests to jot down their thoughts .

Note to self : very cool . “ See , you have this strange new mood ; it ’s very easy , but it ’s still very serious . ”The serious part was telling . For some time , the music that accompanies the collection has been just and his guitar . For this show , he sung most of the words in French . “ I wanted to create dark , heavy music , so in this case , English sounded too light , ” he explained . Whatever emotion people felt , the clothes were certainly not heavy . Yamamoto relied primarily on cotton — washed toile and poplin — instead of the usual gabardine , and introduced a suite of fine - gauge knits , their sheer effect more sensual than usual . Further on , the complex creations gave way to more reduced , more exposed designs . These were the most beautiful dresses of the lot , yet to Yamamoto , they represented the predicament of the present . “ It ’s this crazy global warming , you know . But I do n’t want girls to show too much of their body , just the back , ” he said before revealing that the stickers on their skin were rather racy . One read , Love Yohji Sex . The fact that he noted “ people are suffering ” without claiming his clothes would solve this felt honest , if nothing more . And there was something about the bustled looks toward the end that suggested he was just as content looking back as forward . Still , the multitude of shoes offered some sort of metaphorical path : wedge sandals , tennis shoes , futuristic sneakers , derbies , desert boots , open - toed oxfords ; each shifted the reading of the looks , from feminine to intellectual to survivalist . They reaffirmed that ’s approach befits a wide swath of women — far more than we give him credit for .",1,

In Paris this morning he revealed both his women’s and men’s collections, which were developed with a similar resolution (though the women’s side was a bit glitzier). “It’s kind of a three-part series of ideas. I wanted one to be . . . the opposite of the image of luxury, but done in materials that are considered luxurious,” he said. “Things that are destroyed, some of which have been partially repaired. The other was about mountaineering, but mountaineering in the ’70, before they had high-tech material, before they had Gore-Tex. And the last was patchworking.”The best of these concepts was Abe’s anti-luxe sentiment. He showed a ratty scarf that had holes cut out from its ends—but the material was cashmere. For men, there was a textured blazer with those mock-moth-eaten abrasions, which exposed a quirky Hawaiian floral-print lining beneath. For women, there was a simple crewneck cashmere sweater, likewise maimed by hand. (Abe mentioned that he had instructed his factory staff exactly where, and how big, to make the cuts.)

Stella McCartney,spring-2017-menswear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-menswear/stella-mccartney,"There’s a lot to say about whatStella McCartneygot up to in London on November 10. During the day, she was previewing her debut menswear collection and her Pre-Spring 2017 womenswear at a Methodist chapel she’d hired just across the street from the Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles recorded their album of the same name in 1969. She mentioned, in passing, that she was going to have “a party” at the studios later. Turned out, it was more of a mini-Glastonbury of a night, with DJ sets and live performances on two stages from the Beastie Boys, Beth Ditto, Neneh Cherry, Professor Green, Sharleen Spiteri, and more. A very relaxed, very British-music and fashion-friends-and-family affair it was.This is the way Stella rolls these days. Springing surprise happenings on people, as she did in Paris last month, rehearsing models to break into a dance routine at the end of her runway show, is one of McCartney’s humanizing talents. Making fashion fun to be around, less icy, less pretentiously distant, and part of normal life is essential to her subliminal brand value. This time the models were standing around with everyone else, eating pizza served from Stella McCartney boxes.But to the clothes. Earlier in the day, McCartney was talking about the menswear presentation. “It’s something I started thinking about eleven years ago, when I launched the Adidas collection and a guy came up to me and said, ‘Would you do that for men?’ ” she said. “That definitely planted a seed.” Her choice of location begged the obvious question: How much of the collection was related to the influence of her father, Sir Paul McCartney? Answer: bits and pieces, but not all that much. She pointed to a blue shirt embroidered with swallows. “It was mum’s, but then I saw a picture of dad wearing it.” A blue organic denim embroidered shirt was inspired by an earlier Beatles-era snap. “It was more the Maharishi phase. He was wearing it over a formal English shirt.” Another obvious question: Did her husband Alasdhair Willis have any input? “No,” she laughed, though Willis did wear her black boxy-jacketed suit with draped tailored cargo pants to her last show. “We keep our work separate!

""But,"" she added, ""even though we are talking about minimalism again, it cannot be sad and depressing.""Prada's opening declaration—a black wool Empire-line dress precisely seamed in a V under the bust and edged in lace at the knee—showed how skilled she is at navigating her way into a new mood. Tougher and darker, it still conveyed a shapely femininity—one that was concisely pulled together between the disciplined chic of a ballerina updo and a platform slingback. And dispensing with overdone surfaces revealed again what this designer stands for in terms of cut. Her top-seamed, sharp-lapelled, waist-defining coats, ballooning blousons, and swingy astrakhans showed an elegant command of volume gleaned from her lifelong obsession with couture classics.Some looks, like the mohair V-neck sweaters, belted over narrow skirts and worn with patent opera gloves, referenced Prada's own previous work: the wearable pieces that make women seek out this label season after season. But she avoided nineties starkness with boldly modern roller prints on dresses and shirts, and quirky appliqués of crochet and passementerie on a series of coats.

Balmain,pre-fall-2021,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2021/balmain,"Remember heading to the meeting feeling as sharp as your tailoring? Or hitting the grimy dive for a gig in black denim, lurex, or leather? How about a spot of tennis in way-too-much-for-Wimbledon pastel pleats in a luxe ’90s track top? Down the inevitable Zoom Olivier Rousteing was tangibly excited at the prospect of 2021 allowing us to get reacquainted with these and the many other human pleasures that demand physical presence. And in this ebullient and enormous pre-fall collection Rousteing was effectively placing a cosmic order for all that he hopes might happen in the year ahead.“It’s a collection for morning-to-evening, and it’s a collection that is about taking care of yourself,” he said. “But when I say taking care of yourself I mean by going outside your home and doing what you enjoy. We’ve all been taking care of ourselves by staying in our homes, staying in pajamas, robes, hoodies. But maybe let’s think about the idea of going out, seeing people we haven’t seen for months, and taking pleasure in seeing and being seen.”Rousteing’s enforced year of living digitally—“showing collections on the iPad, urgh, it’s just not right”—has convinced this earliest of fashion’s digital early adopters that there is no substitution for Being There. “We are working with emotion. And we are working with people who have great craft and expertise. And the result of that is a reality. So I don’t believe in showing just virtually. Don’t get me wrong, I love social media, but it is a tool for communication, not for creation.”What Rousteing created in this collection was a convincing Balmain pitch for a joyous post-vaccination wardrobe.

Marc Jacobs,fall-2024-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2024-ready-to-wear/marc-jacobs,"“I believe in living with authenticity—free from validation and permission of absurd conservatism and societal norms.” Marc Jacobs said he was after “joy, period” at his show tonight. It lasted all of six minutes—a short, sharp shock—but it made a big, big impression. I saw Marilyn Monroe in her iconic subway grate dress fromThe Seven Year Itch, Minnie Mouse in her red and white polka dots, and princess gowns out of a Disney classic. There were other references for other eyes, but there’s no debate that this was a collection full of main character energy.The future can feel like it’s closing in, with the far right gaining ground across Europe and the U.S., threatening reproductive freedoms, gay marriage, and other rights Jacobs holds dear. Reckoning with these issues can be heavy work; some may question if the runway is even the right medium. But it’s Jacobs’s chosen medium, and he’s developed a healthy knack for underscoring sticky current issues of late. What would the world look like if he was in charge? It’s a safe place for all kinds, but especially the oddballs who wear too-big shoes and clothes with cartoonish proportions, who prefer hyperbole to the understatement of quiet luxury.Jacobs, just for the record, is completely capable of quiet luxury; his fall 2010 collection, a personal favorite, stands as the sine qua non of that style. But that’s not what this moment calls for, a fact he seemed to underscore with a soundtrack featuring Philip Glass’sEinstein on the Beach, an opera about the anxieties of the information age, and, a little more unseriously, with his own nail art, which he keeps assiduous track of on his Instagram. Of his latest “out-of-control French manicure with pastel colors,” he told Hunter Abrams inVogue, “there’s this joy I get from dressing up, accessorizing, and expressing myself; [nails are a] component in that kind of joyous puzzle.”On the runway: more puzzle pieces. It looked like a sequel to his spring 2024 blockbuster, only here the doll clothes motif had a Hollywood gloss: Marilyn and Minnie and all the rest. Either that or he was looking back at his own oeuvre and giving it an exaggerated spin (remember, he celebrated his brand’s 40th anniversary in February, an important milestone). A large-buttoned skirt suit familiar from his more understated era had a super-shrunken shape, while the hourglass of a lace dress was exaggerated, befitting an animated bombshell, and sweater sets and a-line skirts had the Plain Jane knocked right out of them in acid colors. There was even an itsy-bitsy, teenie-weenie yellow polka dot bikini, only it wasn’t itsy-bitsy or teenie-weenie, but several sizes too big, like a doll in real girls’ clothes.The proportions played funny tricks on you as the models walked the New York Public Library’s impossibly long, narrow hallway, and a similar effect can be seen in these pictures: The miniskirts’ ultra-short lengths, and the arcing hemlines of knee-length skirts, especially when they were higher in front than in the back, made other models look like giants—protagonists if for no other reason that you couldn’t peel your eyes off of them.

There were the years when things didn't go quite right, when the YSL dream job turned nightmare, when he felt like the eternal outsider in fashion's sleek inner circle. But here he is a decade later, A-number one, top of the list, king of the hill, and somewhere deep inside, there must be a voice cooing to Elbaz that revenge is sweet.The clothes he showed today certainly were. But not sweet like the pyramids of cakes that greeted guests at the after-show party. No, these outfits were suh-weet in their body-enhancing shape; their intense, delicious color; their feeling of wayward fun. Elbaz has always exalted womanliness (tonight he even confessed that he'd be happy to be considered a designer who reshaped women), and here there was a generous emphasis on the curve. Roundness too, especially in skirts that flared from hips.But if you were to attempt to plumb Elbaz's appeal—and the sheer joy that seemed to animate tonight's audience shows how deep it runs—it might be the fun element that hits first. His ten years at Lanvin have given women a license to dress up, get down. The party section of the collection announced itself with gold brocade, then quickly leaped to glittering appliqués, beaded sheaths, exuberant prints, and intarsia-ed furs.The models literally had diamonds—OK,sparkles—on the soles of their shoes. And when Aymeline Valade worked the runway in a black dress with a huge white ruffle coiling around her body, it brought back memories of those purely pleasurable fashion moments when catwalk divas like Pat Cleveland shamelessly strutted in the name of style.Elbaz remembers those good times. Hence, the carnival atmosphere of his show closer and everything that came afterward. Alber himself crooned ""Que Sera, Sera,"" with a backing group of signal figures from his past.

Gabriele Colangelo,resort-2014,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2014/gabriele-colangelo,"Gabriele Colangelo made his first trip to Tokyo recently, and the experience stuck with him. ""I was so impressed that when I came back, I couldn't clear it out of my head,"" he said. It was probably inevitable that even as his business in Milan ramps up—he was speaking from his new, larger showroom—a trip like that would seep its way into his collection. Colangelo translated the traditional shibori-dyed pieces he saw in Japan into their contemporary equivalent: Pass on the time-intensive shibori process, bring on the polyurethane.

Ashish,spring-2017-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-ready-to-wear/ashish,"Ever since the vote on Brexit this summer, there has been an alarming rise in reports of racially motivated attacks and hate crimes. Britain’s exit from Europe has emboldened the country’s racists. Last nightAshishGupta—who emigrated from Delhi to London in 1996—gave his take: “I know people who have been abused recently. It’s very upsetting. You know, when Brexit happened, it was the first time in 20 years I felt that maybe I am unwelcome in the country I consider my home.”Gupta took his bow wearing a T-shirt that readImmigrant, following his beguiling, sentimental, and moving revel in Indian-ness—and everything-ness. “Tonight I wanted to celebrate Indian culture, because it is also such an integral part of British culture,” the designer explained.This collection was culturally specific, yes. But it was also about the cultural intermingling that Gupta personifies. His intricate embroidery and sequin work was applied with equal love to saris, salwars, churidars, lungis, and sherwanis as it was to track pants, tracksuits, denim basketball shorts, T-shirts, and other staples of urban sportswear. There was a group of whimsically full-skirted Bollywood leading-lady dresses, too. At the far end of the runway a blind sitar virtuoso named Baluji Shrivastav played intoxicatingly. One model—Richie Shazam—bravely walked a look accessorized by a huge live snake coiled around his neck. The snake came from a reputable animal handler, while Shazam hailed from New York.Gupta said afterward, “I’ve done a lot of casting on Instagram and the street. You know, I think people concentrate on black models or white models when there is a whole rainbow.

Brock Collection,pre-fall-2019,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2019/brock-collection,"When you think of Brock Collection, you invariably think of a dress—one that’s vintage-y, maybe a little sexy, and definitely floral. Kristopher and Laura Brock have a way with bustier dresses and peplum cocktail frocks, and they tick the right boxes: They’re editorially interesting, but have real-world appeal to a variety or women, too. It’s easy to spot the Brocks’ influence in department stores and high-street chains (consider the prevalence of antique florals, puff sleeves, and underwire details), and women as disparate as Emily Ratajkowski and Elle Fanning rely on their dresses for red carpet events.With that in mind, the Brocks could probably manage an entire business of dresses alone. (And, indeed, women have been asking the Brocks for wedding gowns and bridesmaids dresses.) But they’re up for a bigger challenge—so for Pre-Fall, their focus shifted to tailoring. They introduced an elegant, longline bouclé coat in ivory or bright lavender with full, gently rounded sleeves and a moveable button at the center, so you can cinch it tight or wear it a bit looser. It filled the just-right gray area between a cozy, casual robe coat and a fancy evening piece. There were several hip-length, unlined tweed jackets, too, which felt new not just for the Brocks, but for the market in general; in a sea of oversize blazers, a soft, collarless jacket looks fresh.That focus on tailoring inevitably begged the question of a pantsuit. The Brocks’ version came in brick-red gingham with a shirt jacket in lieu of a more formal peak-lapel blazer.

With the 10th anniversary of his self-named collection, Siriano has hit a milestone few young designers can claim. Handling the progression from reality upstart to red carpet favorite with a flair few could match, he’s been on a roll of late, cultivating a fanbase marked by its diversity. At the Grand Lodge this afternoon, ’90s rom-com queen Meg Ryan, rapper Cardi B, and trans activist Laverne Cox all sat in the front row, a lineup that illustrates the breadth of women drawn to Siriano’s gilded take on glamour.Much like greatest-hits compilations, anniversary collections aren’t as much about the creator as they are about the fans. Distilling years worth of work down to the well loved signatures means understanding exactly what your brand is about. For Siriano, that meant revisiting his hallmarks: from ladylike separates rendered in shimmering fabric to ball gowns of the epic variety. Starting with Ashley Graham in a crimson faux fur coat cinched with a matching red belt and leading to a section of vampy numbers worn with thigh-high boots or barely-there stilettos, Siriano kept the vibe sexy. He played with texture via cruelty-free materials before delving into a series of evening looks created in crystal-covered velvet. Metallic jacquard drama was also on the agenda.Given that Siriano was ahead of the curve when comes to body-positive fashion (and when it comes to using the red carpet as a platform for more than prettiness), he couldn’t resist adding in a few empowering messages into the mix. HisPeople are Peoplemantra found its way onto tote bags and the range of ages, body types, and backgrounds on his catwalk continues to be impressive. Sending actress Selma Blair down the runway in a catsuit covered in script, he nodded to Time’s Up. “That Selma look was really inspired by her celebrating her body, her power in this world,” said Siriano. “She was one of the first women to come forward during the #MeToo movement and I felt like was important to put her in a powerful look that she felt amazing in.”It’s that emotional connection to the clothes that serves as Siriano’s biggest selling point. Though the flamboyant gowns of his grand finale may have veered too close to the familiar, with shapes echoing everything from vintage De la Renta to current Saint Laurent, they elicited cries of pleasure from the audience.

Marios Schwab,fall-2008-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2008-ready-to-wear/marios-schwab,"London is thinking long—sinuously, serpentinely long in the case of Marios Schwab's incredibly impactful Fall silhouette. Schwab is the first to completely nail the new look in a bravely exaggerated form: smooth, tubular, hobbling stretch dresses to the ankle, with strange textures breaking through their surfaces. Some of them had patches of under-things—jeans or poufy upswellings of flesh-colored Lycra—rising through roughly scissored slits. Others were covered with filigree-fine laser cutouts engineered to look like sooty, flaking Victorian William Morris wallpaper.It was strange, it was sinister—and mesmerizing. Without doubt, it threw up a glaring issue about how anyone could wear it as is (if you wanted to perambulate across a room within five minutes, forget it). But by the end, the cumulative effect neutralized that kind of pragmatic niggle. This was Schwab's most conceptual collection yet, arguably one that is powerful enough to push the reset button in how we see proportions.What led him here was a reading of a Victorian proto-feminist novel,The Yellow Wallpaper,by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, followed by a collaboration with the artist Tom Gallant on the prints. Those influences scarcely matter to the results, though, which look new and ""out there"" in a way few designers dare in these days of commercial constraints. Not that there weren't salable-looking, impeccably made navy peacoats (two, tramline straight, were elongated to hit the ankle). The point is that this is one of those symbolically charged collections that may be a bellwether.

Helmut Lang,fall-1998-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-1998-ready-to-wear/helmut-lang,"Fashion is in a state of flux. Whether the system is broken or whether patience has gone the way of the horse-drawn carriage can be debated. What’s clear is that the global reach and immediacy of the digital world has increased awareness of and desire for fashion. It has also shown up the lag time between presentation and fulfillment, which can run up to six months later. In a see-it-want-it-now world, that might as well be eons. While there’s no consensus yet as to how the situation can be fixed,Vetements,Burberry, andTom Fordwill break with the current system going forward.So is the upcomingFall 2016 seasonthe last as we’ve known them? Or rather, as we’ve known them since the Fall 1998 season, when modernistHelmut Lang, perhaps the most emulated designer among the new gen, turned the system, successfully, on its head using technology to democratize the experience of seeing his collection? (A season later, Lang would move his live runway show from Paris to New York; he is the reason the season starts in the U.S. rather than it once had, in Europe.)For Lang, this was much more than the mere flip of a calendar page. The presentation of his Fall 1998 collection on the Internet was part of his inclusive, forward-thinking, and technology-friendly philosophy. And it made sense in terms of his aesthetic, too: It wasn’t a stretch to think that a designer who embraced minimalism and tech fabrics and who had long incorporated elements of workwear into his garments would be tech-savvy. The same could not be said of the fashion world at the time.So how did it all come about? We reached out to the designer turned fine artist, who explained via email:“This was at the moment when I moved my company from Europe to the United States. As I was preparing for our next‘séance de travail,’which was highly anticipated, I felt that it was in many ways a new beginning for me, and also a new beginning for how to communicate my work. I sensed at the time that the Internet would grow into something much bigger than imaginable, so I thought it was the right moment to challenge the norm and present the collection online. It was a shock to the system, but a beginning of the new normal. In terms of the broader context of the industry, we made in the same season the entire collection available on a public platform, allowing consumers for the first time to get an unfiltered view of my work.”Today, in homage to Lang’s brilliant move, we present on Vogue Runway his timeless Fall 1998 show in its entirely. We asked Kirsten Owen, the designer’s muse, to share her memories of the collection. “If I can quote Juergen Teller,” she replied, “ ‘It was more of a smell than a memory, of raw concrete and hi-fi. Definitely a buzz.’ ” Generating this excitement was Lang’s masterful balance of tailoring and flou, neon brights and neutrals, and the unexpected touch (bunny ears) that made this first virtual show as sartorially memorable as it was historically important.",Laird Borrelli-Persson,"February 9, 2016","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/56b924a67f0b8b2a6b764d51/master/w_1280,c_limit/01.jpg",,fall,1998,ready-to-wear,1990,Helmut Lang,,,"Fashion is in a state of flux .

We reached out to the designer turned fine artist , who explained via email:“This was at the moment when I moved my company from Europe to the United States . As I was preparing for our was highly anticipated , I felt that it was in many ways a new beginning for me , and also a new beginning for how to communicate my work . I sensed at the time that the Internet would grow into something much bigger than imaginable , so I thought it was the right moment to challenge the norm and present the collection online . It was a shock to the system , but a beginning of the new normal . In terms of the broader context of the industry , we made in the same season the entire collection available on a public platform , allowing consumers for the first time to get an unfiltered view of my work . ”Today , in homage to ’s brilliant move , we present on Vogue Runway his timeless Fall 1998 show in its entirely . We asked , the designer ’s muse , to share her memories of the collection . “ If I can quote , ” she replied , “ ‘ It was more of a smell than a memory , of raw concrete and hi - fi . Definitely a buzz . ’ ” Generating this excitement was masterful balance of tailoring and flou , neon brights and neutrals , and the unexpected touch ( bunny ears ) that made this first virtual show as sartorially memorable as it was historically important .",1,

It's not every designer whose work stands up to that level of scrutiny, but Sacai thrives in the close-up. Her odd combinations of fibers, patterns, even genres of clothing—she's famous for shirts that end with panels of drawstring-laced nylon, like windbreakers—can't be called subtle, and yet, like a magic trick, you find yourself staring, trying to see how they work.This season, she turned her attention to traditional menswear patterns and to florals. Both are well-worn territory, but Abe's a dab hand. She printed houndstooth and Prince of Wales on nylon jackets and shirts, layering them to glossy, twinset effect. College-scarf stripes, picked out in grosgrain, were great on a hooded parka, layered over a matching sweatshirt. And Abe's jacquard florals, densely packed together on dark, neutral colors, took on a camouflage effect. Even the simplest pieces, like a two-tone polo that suggested a shirt collar flapping over a sweater, had a little spark. Abe doesn't bother with themes, backstories, or explanations.

But fast-forward a year, and the pandemic has definitely changed our dressing habits: We’ve grown more accustomed to ease at the same time that we expect our clothes to stand up to the challenges our new lives throw at us. The evidence of that was on today’s Max Mara runway in clothes that took their shape and attitude not from officewear but workwear, much of it in rigid, dark-rinse denim.Creative director Ian Griffiths was backstage talking about Françoise Sagan’s masterpieceBonjour Tristesseand the Otto Preminger movie based on it in which Jean Seberg sports chambray with her swimwear. Griffiths chose the story for the way its main character travels in her mind, which is something we all did during the lockdowns. He called Sagan a beatnik in a bourgeois’s body, which just about sums up the push-pull of the two sides of this lineup. Max Mara is known for its excellent Italian-made outerwear.

And he's imagined a new girl to put in them: ""She's angry, but funny-angry,"" he said before the show, ""A girl who steals from her mother. I want this to be young-young, with no tricks. Clean, but not minimal.""So she came over as bit of a handful, this one: a stomping little character with a taste for asymmetric black, orange, and nylon-look trash-bag fabric, rather than broderie anglaise first-communion dresses and peasant smocks. Her boots are based on Doc Martens and ""Diane Arbus"" galoshes, and she has a giant textured green messenger bag slung across her back like a guitar case. She likes print, texture, and off-colors too—and Melim Andersson has a lot of them, with a glossary of nutty names to match: ""Secret Garden"" trees, ""Murder Scene"" streaks, ""Magpie"" jeweled embroidery, and ""Mushy Pea"" green.Enough time has elapsed after the departure of Phoebe Philo for Chloé's pretty, vintage-y flyaway aesthetic to be in need of an update. After a long search, Melim Andersson (a British-educated Scandinavian designer whose first job was at Margiela) was hired from that other left-field girlie brand, Marni, and at this first outing something in the Marimekko-type print and square-cut, off-kilter shapes carried the traces of his former employment.The show had energy, but it's too early to judge how any newcomer will make his mark based on one collection (it took quite a few seasons for Philo to climb to the ranks of cult leader, after all). For now, the pertinent question is whether Melim Andersson gets the fact that Chloé has to be an easily broken down assemblage of fab pieces that fly out of shops. Reactions were split over that. This season label loyalists will zoom in on familiar items like the loose, orange semi-sheer dress with a drop waist and ruffled flutter in the skirt, the shifts and skirts decorated with plastic paillettes and crystal, and a few (maybe too few, since it's winter) re-cut boyfriend coat-jackets to throw on over them. What's new is that this Fall there are also lures for an edgier, tougher customer, like the slithery nylon-look bustier sheath with an unzippable collar, and a cool asymmetric sleeveless shift with volume caught into the lower back.

Agnona,pre-fall-2020,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2020/agnona,"Helene Schjerfbeck was a Finnish painter born in the mid-19th century, known for charming self-portraits and a sense of melancholic realism; her work was recently the subject of an exhibition at London’s Royal Academy of Arts. The slightly chilly Scandi hauteur that permeates her oeuvre resonates with Simon Holloway’s penchant for restrained, sophisticated elegance. The severe high-neck dresses the artist often portrayed herself in constituted a starting point for Agnona’s pre-fall collection.The crisscrossed neckline was one of the many subtly elegant details in the lineup; it was translated into turtlenecks or into the collars of coats and jackets. The season’s silhouette was a bit boyish and slender, with a cool Northern sense of clarity. Softly tailored masculine coats and suits made for a compelling proposition, with deconstructed shapes not detracting from precision but adding ease and comfort. A beautifully cut checkered coat in soft Prince of Wales brushed cashmere had lapels made from alpaca, replicating an old-school mink collar. Elsewhere, a feminine flair was apparent in the considered use of floral prints, including a botanical-inspired wintry motif of dried pressed leaves and an abstract floral pattern printed on silk twill with a virtuoso technique of needle-punched cashmere that created a romantic faded sfumato effect.As always with Agnona, the variety and quality of fabrics were as high as can be. This season, Holloway raised the bar on the label’s responsible sourcing. “In reality, we already start on a very good base in terms of responsible use of fabrics,” he explained. “Nearly everything in our collections has always been natural.” But since the sustainable game is getting tougher, Agnona is responding with an even keener awareness of best practices. To start, it is addressing more responsible sourcing of synthetic yarns. “For example, the viscose in our viscose cady is now sustainably sourced; that is, the trees from which it is harvested are replanted, instead of leaving a barren forest,” said Holloway. Cotton shirting is also almost completely organic and responsibly farmed; the polyester blended into wools to make the fabric stretch has been replaced with recycled polyester; and the nylon used for the inside of quilted jackets is now only recycled. “We no longer use synthetic padding or down feathers for filling puffer jackets; we use only recycled cashmere,” continued the designer. “We can’t fix everything overnight, but this season we’ve tackled every single aspect that we could in a more cohesive way.” The company’s approach to responsible luxury is a praiseworthy example of commitment and engagement on issues crucial today for the fashion industry—and for the world.",Tiziana Cardini,"December 10, 2019","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5dee526140b28900082c4e18/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-Agnona-Pre-Fall-20.jpg",,pre-fall,2020,other,2020,,,,"was a Finnish painter born in the mid-19th century , known for charming self - portraits and a sense of melancholic realism ; her work was recently the subject of an exhibition at .

For pre-fall, she gave them a little aughties twist, but it’s the mix that makes her such a Parisian icon: washed-out denim cargos with lace are a typical Marantian play.Masculine, oversized cuts—like a gray double-breasted suit, a roomy black tee, low-slung denims, and ample overcoats—were balanced by feminine touches, like white clogs or thigh-highs in curve-hugging stretch leather. As a counterpoint, she amped up femininity through lingerie inspirations such as a dévoré red velvet corset, a fuchsia stretch linen bustier dress that looked like it could work in any season, or slip dresses like one in black silk satin with broderie anglaise inserts and an open back.“It’s a femininity that’s a little boyish and rather minimal and discreetly sensual,” the designer offered during a showroom visit. Along with her first lieutenant, Kim Bekker, Marant said she strived to keep silhouettes simple and precise, focusing on refined materials and colors, “so you can just throw on a dress, or pants and a jacket and you’re done.”Other motifs included embroideries on a velvet halter-neck zip-up and a carpet-like print reprised in pinks and blues on a favorite jacket shape, paired with “leather track pants.” Rather than revolutionize every time, the designer prefers to exercise restraint, stick to her heritage, and bring her vocabulary to different contexts.“There has to be a certain reasonableness to the joy of buying a new piece of clothing,” Marant said. “These things are meant to stay in closets for a long time, so they have to be done right.”",Tina Isaac-Goizé,"January 26, 2023","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/63d29ab9350318b5da8747c3/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-isabel-marant-pre-fall-2023-credit-brand.jpg",,pre-fall,2023,other,2020,Isabel Marant,1967.0,Studio Berçot,"The ’ 90s are back in force these days , which presents ample occasion for Isabel Marant to dip into some of her favorite signatures .

Alexandre Vauthier,spring-2018-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2018-ready-to-wear/alexandre-vauthier,"According to Alexandre Vauthier, when David Bellemere was shooting Luna Bijl outside the Hôtel Le Meurice earlier this week for the designer’s lookbook, drivers on the Rue de Rivoli didn’t hold back on the honking. Hardly a surprise; Vauthier’s clothes exist to stop traffic. Maybe that’s a slight exaggeration, but there’s no question these ready-to-wear looks signal the Parisian va-va-voom of his most recent haute couture collection, only now within (relative) reach. Should you have an occasion that merits the same daring violet metallic jersey dress and boots worn by Aurélie Dupont, the dance director of the Paris Opera Ballet, to the opening gala last week, you’re in luck. Despite the switch to lamé, its slinkiness is, for all intents and purposes, identical.Of the looks that Bellemere shot throughout the hotel—from Alain Ducasse’s kitchen to the Salvador Dalí suite—there were others that differed only in surface detail. Sequins replaced Lesage embroidery on a hot little number ringed in a ruffle around its one shoulder, for instance. Given that this lineup delivers in Spring, couture cashmere would be moot, anyway. Arguably, these cotton voile polka-dot dresses put an easier spin on 1980s chic than the haute originals in stiffer silk organza.Moving past the comparisons, Vauthier’s proposition arrives at a time when a nod back to such a glamorous moment feels welcome. As someone who will never dabble in ugly or eccentric, his strass-spotted jean jackets and micro-studded slip dresses not only feel most authentic, he said they are increasingly sparking interest among retailers who know that, eye-roll if you must, sex always sells.That said, let’s suppose you were the wife of a dashing, driven president who defied all odds, you would still find any number of Vauthier’s statement jackets and tailored pants to request for state visits and official ceremonies. Understandably reserved about his rapport with Brigitte Macron, he seems chuffed all the same.

Vera Wang,bridal-spring-2018,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/bridal-spring-2018/vera-wang,"“I wanted to offer my clients a different viewpoint,” said Vera Wang of her latest bridal collection. The designer said the 20 looks were her new take on romanticism: “I felt frustrated by what is typically thought of romantic.” Instead, she offered up a new concept focused on sleeves and asymmetry.This rethink was most successful on a daring, body-skimming crepe dress, which featured an exaggerated draped sleeve on one side, a tulle whisper of a sleeve on the other, and an oversize black silk flower on the shoulder. “It’s not simply about the components of a dress that are traditionally bridal-related, like lace and chiffon and all these other materials,” Wang said. “It’s a total exploration of viewing a wedding gown in another context, but still being relatable to modern, young women.”Wedding day purists will fawn over the designer’s signature ivory lace offerings, like the sleeveless, plunging V-neck gown with scallop detailing and a more demure long-sleeved version. But it’s when Wang pushed the envelope of conventional weddingwear that she reminded us why she’s been the reigning queen for decades. “I’m trying to push [brides] in a different direction,” she said. The most avant-garde will appreciate the cutaway dress with three-quarter sleeves embellished with sheared-tulle flowers, pearls, and a tuxedo cape, which looked like something Tilda Swinton might wear on an upcoming red carpet.Wang’s hope is that by presenting a new, global perspective on bridal, the tides will shift away from sweetheart necklines and mermaid hems. “There are many brides in this room,” she said, “and there are different personalities.

Here there was a combination of the ancient and contemporary, resulting in a place where diadems might seem perfectly realizable for the everyday.

Working remotely with his team in Italy from the British countryside helped him refocus his practice. “I couldn’t have made it without them,” he said during a showroom appointment. “It wasn’t about the office mentality anymore, but about coming together to make the collection actually happen.”Long wanted to convey a feeling of optimism for the future, so he worked on a relaxed, off-duty wardrobe for the coed offering, inspired by a hopeful dream of coming back to happier times,La Dolce Vitastyle. “We couldn’t travel anywhere, so I fantasized about traveling,” he said. For lack of IRL options, he took a virtual trip into Iceberg’s archives, where he found a heritage pattern inspired by the Sistine Chapel’s famous Michelangelo frescoThe Creation of Adam,giving it a bright Pop art vibe with what he called “an escapist palette.” “I wanted to reinforce the Italian-ness of what we’re doing,” Long said. The motif was printed on a loose-fitting, ankle-grazing summer dress, on a soft-tailored pantsuit with an easygoing feel, and on a plissé skirt worn with a roomy knitted sweater, with an intarsia split-in-half image of Iceberg’s mascot, Mickey Mouse.Further referencing the label’s Italian Riviera roots, a laid-back attitude was similarly apparent in the men’s collection, only it was punctuated with more rugged, utilitarian, and military accents. Think safari vests built into T-shirts, anoraks emblazoned with oversized pockets, and high-end technical quirks nodding to the world of luxury sports.Long spent his quarantine in his hometown of Althorp, in Northamptonshire—which also happens to be the home of Princess Diana’s family estate. “I got into thinking about her, and about her look when she started to be more free, going out on her own and letting everything go,” he mused. Waxing a bit nostalgic, he wanted to channel her off-duty uniform of sweater sets and two-piece easy suits, “her school pick-up and drop-off style,” as he described it. An egg-yolk yellow blazer worn with matching leggings and a bandeau top would’ve surely whipped the hordes of paparazzi chasing the Princess into a frenzy.That said, in general both collections had a calmer, simpler attitude than usual. Long hopes to bring what he has learned in lockdown into his fashion practice in the future. He also reused and upcycled materials—nylons, cottons, knitwear yarns—for both collections. “I’d like to keep a more considerate and focused approach to how we work,” he said. “I feel very privileged to have a job that I love; I’m much more appreciative of how much human effort goes into what we do—and of how many people would be affected if we weren’t doing what we do.”",Tiziana Cardini,"July 29, 2020","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5f1b043e10c0c80fa64c3c96/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-Iceberg-Mens-SS21.jpg",,spring,2021,menswear,2020,James Long,,Royal College of Art,"The lockdown has proved a learning curve for , ’s creative director , as it has for many other designers .

New baby, a smash-hit gig for H&M, and a line of attention-grabbing activewear for Adidas. Well done for all that—but has she had enough in reserve to concentrate on her own brand? Her collection didn't really look like it. What she showed—big cocoon cardigans with sloppy collars, skimpy printed jersey dresses, mixed with A-line smocks and swing coats—lacked the stylistic grip and polish expected from a player in the premier league of Parisian fashion. Granted, something in their sixties/eighties spirit glanced in the right direction, but the focus seemed fuzzy.The presentation took place in the pompous surroundings of the gilded salon of the Grand Hotel, a habitat perennially associated with the rarefied métier of haute couture showings. Maybe that was a policy choice intended to separate her top line from other things she's doing, but you can't help thinking there are bolder strategies, beyond selection of venue, that could be used to leverage the equity behind brand McCartney. In a season when menswear tailoring is so much on the agenda, she could, for instance, have upped the luxe content by celebrating her signature Savile Row pantsuits, whose cut can't be achieved at mass level. Then again, perhaps a better way to go about it would be to turn her collection into a microcosm of the high-low fashion reality that McCartney embodies.

The first stop was Lafayette and Center Streets in Manhattan, the second was at Astor Place; both were open to the public, though announced. The press and retailers were invited to a dead end in Bushwick, Brooklyn—as it happens, directly across the street from the venue Eckhaus Latta presented in earlier this afternoon. Anybody who went to that show got a sneak peek of #WANGFEST’s after-party jumpy castle.Last Fall, Wang sold his Adidas merch off the back of a truck, Canal Street–style, in different parts of the city. Tonight’s events were designed to capture the guerrilla nature of those mobile pop-ups. It’s an aspect that Wang clearly likes. Otherwise, why not have the lights all set up and ready to go? Maybe the shows came off better in Manhattan. After all, you don’t just see 32 supermodels—Kendall, Bella, and Kaia included—pour out of a bus every night. But penned up in Brooklyn, after waiting in the cold for an hour past the advertised start time, the third show lacked a sense of spontaneity. We knew what we were getting, we’d already seen the show on Instagram.Collection-wise, though, this was a strong outing for Wang—not necessarily breaking new ground, but much more energetic than his show last season at the RKO Hamilton Theater. The most directional idea was the way he layered cutoffs over leather leggings. You could picture his clients experimenting with that look in real life. He had fun with denim, too, showing a skinny style with one leg covered in silver studs or shredded baggies with an easy drawstring waist. There isn’t a designer around without a deconstructed, off-the-shoulder button-down these days; Wang’s versions come spliced with silk camis or mashed-up with a sports bra, and he extended those metaphors to his tailoring.

How is this even possible?!’ ” With that, Scott tied the ribbon on his Fall women’s and men’s collection, shown together: It was zany, brainy, brilliant in spots and thought-provoking in others. In concrete terms, think: ’80s Italian discos, arcade claw–grab games,The Fifth Element, Juicy-esque tracksuits, neon accessories like the kind you crack open on the Fourth of July, and a hell of a lot of fluorescent fluff (including on the Longchamp bags that Scott lines his front row with each season).Scott celebrated his 20th anniversary six months ago; Fall didn’t depart from his m.o., but it did introduce a few new bits to his singular planet, like, for example, “thigh-high skyscraper Moon Boots” (a new collaboration, with shorter versions available for guys). Likewise, a new capsule with MAC Cosmetics, which dropped today. Also: “I’m working on this particular piece,” he said, pointing to his run-of-show backstage. “It’s like a track jacket and a bra had a baby.” The cropped top, which had an almost corset-like hoist around the chest but then a standard, easy fit around the arms (some had hoods), was easily envisioned on the Gigis (Hadid opened the show) and the Kendalls and possibly the Cardis (B sat front row) of the world. As has been observed, Scott, in his uncompromisingly independent way, is often ahead of the curve, and it was interesting to consider this relatively low-key and casual focus juxtaposed against his more futuro-camp instincts. Will these track jacket–bra hybrids be worn under lava lamp–like rainbow leopard-print sheer sashes, or will structured skirts in see-through orange PVC soon be paired with mini denim jackets, also with built-in pseudo-bras? Who knows, but it’s not so far removed from the believable, given the designer’s track record.Much more in this sci-fi flick flew or slinked by: parachute strapping; puffers with all-over pocketing; a print that morphed the Jeremy Scott name into a font that looked obtusely like Hindi writing; Jetson-like hooped skirting; and metallic finishes on outerwear all included. The fluff (and the cartoon-bear prints) were inspired by Popples bears. Popples were toys that were introduced in the ’80s—sort of like, this writer imagines, the Beanie Babies of the era. Scott has long enjoyed an animated character or two in his collections, but the Popples had a more perverse undertone. “Cicciolina”—the Hungarian-Italian porn star—“used to carry them. So there’s this seductress and cute and cuddly thing at the same time,” said the designer.

Marni,fall-2019-menswear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2019-menswear/marni,"Backstage before today’s show, Marni’s Francesco Risso could’ve easily been mistaken for one of the models patiently waiting to step into the black boom box built inside an industrial space as the set. Risso sported what looked like a spongy hybrid coat/bathrobe in a black-and-white, vaguely nondescript diamond pattern, worn loose, unbelted and trailing, topped with a wool matching-not-matching beret with a dangling pom-pom at the end. He looked like the crazily stylish fashion template around which he has built the new Marni aesthetic.Risso has an oracular, almost esoteric way of explaining his collections’ meaning. His narrative definitely doesn’t lack charm. “I wanted to address the elephant in the room,” he said. “The puppeteers out there who are busy playing soccer with our planet, hanging their coats on elephants’ tusks—they don’t realize that these neuro-tribe movements are emerging from the streets and they’re invading the space: This for me is the sense of this collection. They are atypical kids, extravagant and not diagnosable types. You have to imagine an invasion, like in a 3-D Risk game.”Inside the black boom box, while a rather disquieting remix of Claude Debussy’s “Prélude à l’Après-Midi d’un Faune” was booming, the aforementioned neuro-tribes made their appearance, stomping their banana-sock boots, wearing what looked like a gentle parody of conservative suiting. There were ginormous blazers and matching trailing pants in wool bouclé or moleskin in dark classic colors, “imposing like if they were dressed with moveable apartments,” mused Risso.The conservative, slightly David Byrne–esque, magnified suits slowly unraveled, morphing into grand-scale, full-on pyrotechnics. It was a riotous, sensually crazy, Dionysian psychedelic extravaganza of knitted jumpers or layered pajamas printed in acid-bright patterns. These were inspired byAllegro Non Troppo, a ’70s animated movie by the Italian director Bruno Bozzetto, which was a parody of Walt Disney’sFantasia. “They’re disheveled, disassembled, they are Les Enfants Terribles du Paradis,” enthused the designer.Like a pagan ritual reaching its climax, when delirium unfolds into a sort of quiet stupor, the show’s rhythm regressed into a more muffled atmosphere;l’après-midiof the young fauns approached the twilight zone.

Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig showed a dazzling surfeit of gowns and dresses in shocking pinks, blues, and emerald greens. It was like walking into a psychedelic fairy-tale dreamland, one filled with tutus and lots of sparkle. This is what the designers do best, not only with their red carpet–favorite main line, but also with the more affordable Notte. In fact, the majority of the designs for Notte were based on couture eveningwear from the runways. There’s never any real separate inspiration story for the Notte collections, but they sure are fun to see and probably, thanks to big ball skirts and tiered fringing, fun to wear as well.Aside from the signature embellished pieces for Spring, the blush pink tulle dress with a low V-neck was particularly striking, as was a baby blue and pink gown with ruffled sleeves. 3-D flower embroidery decorated much of the collection, and it might be nice to see Chapman and Craig take a breather from that technique to focus on softer, more delicate details like their tiny pearl adornments or their draped silhouettes.

Michael Kors Collection,fall-2022-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2022-ready-to-wear/michael-kors-collection,"“We could all use a little froth,” Michael Kors announced at a showroom preview. He was talking about a recent trip to Broadway to see Six, the feel-good musical about Henry VIII’s six wives. But he might as well have been talking about his new collection, which in another quotable moment he called the “antithesis of sad slipper life.”Kors is determined to put the pandemic behind him and give his clients a good time. In his 42nd Street design room and in his customers’ closets at home, that means not overthinking things. Major impact à la MK means head-to-toe monochrome, be it in a cool neutral or an electric jolt of coral, yellow, or shocking pink; suiting in classic menswear materials and shapes; and athletically inclined eveningwear. A pair of over-the-knee suede stocking boots give the short lengths he showed here year-round viability. But the absolute non-negotiable is a statement piece of outerwear. “In New York, it’s your calling card,” he said.The inspiration for his clutch coats was Marilyn Monroe. She could make a beach towel look like a million bucks, but Kors’s came in double-face cashmere or faux fur. The shoulders were a key erogenous zone; underneath those clutch coats were racerback shifts or one-sleeve dresses in clingy sequined jersey. Clearly, Kors has dinner dates and nights out at the theater on the brain.First time Best Supporting Actress nominee Ariana DeBose was in the front row near Blake Lively and across the way from Brooke Shields, but if Kors is working on an Oscar dress for the West Side Story star, he’s keeping it under wraps. “There’s not a single full-on evening look that’s not as easy as a T-shirt,” he said.

Bottega Veneta,spring-2025-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2025-ready-to-wear/bottega-veneta,"Matthieu Blazy sure knows how to set a scene. The animal beanbag chairs—Michelle Yeoh on a ladybug, Kendall Jenner on a horse, Jacob Elordi, the new face of the brand, on a bunny—put the Bottega Veneta crowd in a buoyant mood tonight. It was like we were all kids again in a rec room, knees tucked under our chins, eager to watch our favorite show on TV.In his two and a half years at the label, Blazy has turned Bottega Veneta into the show of Milan Fashion Week. There’s the art- and design-world adjacencies—the arkful of leather beanbags were designed by Zanotta Sacco, and some of them will be available for sale on the company’s website tomorrow. And there’s the well-curated crowd—this season’s included the trans TikTok star Jools “Very Demure” Lebron and Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer and Olympian whose gender was questioned by the cyberbully Elon Musk: “Very cool move for them,” as my colleague texted from New York. But in the end, it’s Blazy’s clothes that put him in the league of designers that matter most. He’s the rare guy who can marry the conceptual with the coolly everyday.The concept this season was childhood. “I was interested in the idea of wow, the wonder you have as a kid when you try something—it’s almost like primal fashion, your first experience of fashion when you try your parents’ clothes,” he said. He showed too-big jackets and one-leg pants under asymmetrical wrap skirts, and pieces like a black tank dress and khaki and navy shirtdresses with built-in wrinkles like they’d been crushed at the bottom of a trunk waiting for a game of dress-up.The animal chairs were inspired by the movieE.T., Blazy explained, the scene where Elliott’s mom opens the closet and somehow misses the extraterrestrial hiding among all the stuffed toys. And that theme carried over to the clothes: frogs perching at the neckline of a dress and clinging to the heels of shoes, lapels in the shape of bunnies on leather coats, a scarf top printed with giant fish.If all that sounds unserious, it was, and that’s a risk for a label with deeply serious prices like Bottega’s. Blazy was making a bet that people will share his sense of humor and his heart. It was the right bet to make. In fashion now, especially here in Milan, we’ve seen a lot of playing it safe, of brands in rehash mode or standing in place. Blazy’s fashion, in contrast, looks free, whether he’s putting the accent on craft (did you get a load of the spiky leather wigs?), elevating essentials like Elliott fromE.T.’s flannel shirt and denim (which were neither flannel nor denim, I don’t think), or embellishing a top and skirt with metal matchsticks, because why not?Then there were the simply, brilliantly chic things, like a vivid orange draped jersey dress and an icy white fringed three-quarter-length sleeve coat, and the unmissable bags, the most unusual being the one-of-a-kinds made with leather vests by students at Bottega Veneta’s school.

Luisa Beccaria,fall-2009-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2009-ready-to-wear/luisa-beccaria,"Luisa Beccaria presented her Fall collection at the Villa Necchi Campiglio, a newly restored onetime private Milanese residence built in the early thirties. The parquet floors, high ceilings, and bookshelf-lined walls were a good match for Beccaria's unapologetically romantic vision.

Eudon Choi,spring-2013-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2013-ready-to-wear/eudon-choi,"The London fashion scene is never short on young designers with a directional point of view. More unusual, though, is a designer like Eudon Choi, an up-and-comer with serious commercial knack. Editors in London haven't just been buzzing about Choi for a couple of seasons now, they've also been wearing his clothes, like the oversize varsity jacket he knocked out last Spring, or the Fall 2012 tee crusted with mineral-looking silver and gold. Watching his presentation today, you could see, vaguely, the makings of a Phillip Lim-like career—and it ought to go without saying, that's no bad thing. But if Choi wants to seize that potential, the first thing he has to do is embrace his talent for approachability.There were a lot of pieces in this collection that showed him doing just that. The themes here were Stanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odysseyand futuristic sixties mod. Choi did well when he tethered those references to easy, modern shapes, like a linear jumpsuit in lunar silver or white. He turned out several clever Balenciaga diffusions, such as structured T-shirts with oversize sleeves or all-white looks made from a superb, three-dimensional mesh fabric. A lab coat in the squishy mesh was strong. But the collection lost focus whenever Choi reintroduced his super-reflective, super-stiff patent leathers. As an element, the material worked fine, as when he inserted bands of patent leather into his patchwork minidresses. However, an all-patent black suit just didn't look fresh, and overall there was simply too much shine. You got the sense that Choi felt obliged to attempt an editorial statement, when in fact his heart was in the small innovations, like the Escher-esque sequin embroidery on a slouchy black silk tee.

Bringing down the curtain on Fall 2017 (the fashion shows have been running through the weirdest, most conflict-ridden political four weeks since the late 1960s), Miuccia Prada knew exactly what advice to offer the Miu Miu girls of the world: “It’s about the madness of glamour, in front of an uncertain future,” she said, and then added, “and I am getting really interested in so many kinds of beauty.” In other words?

Prada,fall-2009-menswear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2009-menswear/prada,"As Miuccia Prada saw it, the message of her latest men’s collection was simple and obvious. “Survival,” she said backstage. “And to survive, you have to be strong.” There have been seasons when Miuccia toyed with the fragility, the ineffectuality of the modern male. Not this time, thank God. The setting was a tight little carpeted pit, almost a cage; Thunderdome with shag pile. One model sported a tasseled headband, like an extreme fighter. The clothes themselves began as emblematic Corporate Man: gray suit, matching topcoat, black oxfords. Then in crept an ever-harder edge. First, a laser-cut leather duster, almost monkish in its austerity. Next, a shoe covered with studs, presaging an avalanche of hardware on shirts, pants, jackets. Toughen up, tough it out—that’s what the leather and metal was saying.Still, while you're picturing studs armoring gray flannel or a banker’s striped shirt, you might wonder who, right now, would honestly want to arm erstwhile Masters of the Universe against their just desserts. But Miuccia was presumably using such menswear staples as symbols of Honest Joe Everyman. And it’s Honest Joe who is suffering. Maybe that’s why the patterns that decorated shirts evoked the thirties, another era of values-questioning social upheaval.

She is also the unlikeliest fashion inspiration of Spring 2012. Silvia Venturini Fendi felt she was the perfect embodiment of the very particular type of Milanese woman she wanted to celebrate with the new Fendi collection: serious, practical, possibly academic. As far as Karl Lagerfeld was concerned, the woman he had in mind wasn't so much all that as simply, quintessentially Italian. Monica Vitti, perhaps. It was her voice we could hear on the soundtrack, in snippets from Michelangelo Antonioni's definitive portrait of urban angst,La Notte.Either way, this woman wasn't the va-va-voom Italian sexpot of Loren and Lollobrigida lore. Lagerfeld wanted a solid emphasis on daywear, as an antidote to what he sees as countless collections of cocktail dresses. There was a studious, masculine-feminine interplay in an outfit such as the elastic-waist skirt in the striped cotton of a businessman's shirt, paired with a white blouse down the front of which ran a silk ribbon of trompe l'oeil tie. Box-pleat skirts, A-line jackets, and a navy coat that looked like something a chic researcher might wear elaborated on the notion.But then we were into the ur-Fendi zone, where a certain madness takes hold. There were ensembles that could have been lifted from the closet of an unhinged housewife—the skirt with huge patch pockets trimmed with piecrust frill, the apron-front tops—then there was an evening passage that suggested a wound-up-tight academic looking for Mr. Goodbar while she was harnessed into swirly, sheer black. She was clutching a rather gorgeous fur-trimmed bag, which, said Silvia, was intended to look like a painting.At this point, it may pay to note that the models' bouffants had been somewhat disordered to evoke Albert Einstein's hair.

Givenchy,spring-2016-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2016-ready-to-wear/givenchy,"As more than a thousand people traversed the rush hour–choked West Side Highway and flooded onto Pier 26—all dressed to the nines (or maybe the threes or twos, given the skimpiness of a few notable looks)—it’s fair to say that one of the very last things they were expecting was to be immersed in a contemplative experience. Yet this is what they got fromRiccardo Tiscion the night he brought hisGivenchyshow to New York City, coinciding with the 14th anniversary of 9/11. There was no all-out gig fromRihannaandKanye West(as had been the speculation when “performances” were mentioned), and no inaugural walk fromCaitlyn Jenner, which had been optimistically rumored, given Tisci’s strong credentials as fashion’s first champion of transgender models.Instead, with the aid of his coconspirator, the artist Marina Abramovic, and the cooperation of a staggering sunset across the Hudson, Tisci made his show into a meditation on the losses of 9/11, and on slowing things down in our heads, perhaps to mourn, but also to remember how lucky we are to be alive. The audience—the seated professionals and celebrities, and the standing public—were made to wait and watch for a good hour, absorbing the spectacle of blue sky and white and pink-tinted clouds as Abramovic’s slow-moving performers, dressed in white shirts and black pants, acted out simple, strenuous, and repetitive rituals—one with a ladder, another with a tree, a third with a faucet gushing water.Stop!Abramovic seemed to be saying.Slow down and feel something!And meanwhile, in the foreground, the nonstop parade of personalities kept coming, and kept on being photographed and Instagrammed.As far as style is concerned, this was also Tisci’s opportunity to revisit and refine the ideas he’s been working through for his whole career. This year—in which a Givenchy store opens in New York City—is Riccardo Tisci’s tenth at the house, and there was a serene sense of celebration and coming of age amongst the clothes. It was a collection which spelled out and repeated almost-calligraphic black and white variations of the same sentences: Ivory slip dresses and rouleau-strapped camisoles with lace edges, worn over excellently tailored black pants cut to taper gently over pointed shoes. Supple crepe tuxedo jackets with tails, soft kimono coats, and transparent organdy trenches glimmering with jet embroidery. Many, many body-skimming sparkly silver shifts.Aficionados of Tisci’s track record in Paris would also have re-applauded the most spectacular of his couture dresses—one with a degrade feather effect, and another with leather patches applied on tulle in the shape of alligator skin—which had never before been shown on live models (as opposed to showroom dummies). And then there was the face decoration, taken to the nth degree of freakishly beautiful elaboration, in studded golden jewelry, tulle frills, and lace.That calm exposition of skill and taste, which surely grows out of nineties memories, will stay in the minds of everyone who was on Pier 26 tonight.

DKNY's collections, which consist of tweaked classics brought ably up to date by the line's creative director, Garry Martin, include plenty of tailored options—this season, a whole passage of city-block-gray two-button suits—but they're far more casual than you're likely to see on Wall Street bankers. (Here, the suits were shown with platform-heel Doc Martens; other looks had Superga sneakers and still others, Tevas.)But that's a strength, not a weakness. DKNY's mandate is clothes—working weekday and casual weekend—for the young and the urbane. Martin interpreted that dictum to demand versatility, not only office to evening and back, but all-weather and idiot-proof, too. Blazers and suit pants got nanotech finishes for water- and stain-resistance. Every jacket now has an iPhone pocket hidden in its bonded lining.Outside, overlooking Times Square, coordinated Jumbotrons blasted DKNY's Fall campaign. With that, the venue clicked. Karan's secondary collection may not be for bankers, but it's always been about going big in New York. Remember the famous city-skyline billboard on Houston Street?

Stella McCartney,pre-fall-2018,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2018/stella-mccartney,"“It’s a Stella-bration!” whooped Stella McCartney, sipping Champagne in between sets at the Hollywood concert thrown in honor of her Autumn—the brand’s name for Pre-Fall—men’s and women’s collections. McCartney always does a good pre-collections party, but even for her, last night was a doozy. Not only did St. Vincent, Beck, Grimes, Leon Bridges, and Børns play to a sweaty room stuffed with celebrities, pop stars, and their progeny, but her father, Sir Paul McCartney, walked the red carpet with Ringo Starr, before joining Matt Bellamy and his one-night-only Beatles cover outfit, Dr. Pepper’s Jaded Hearts Club Band, on the elaborately neon-festooned stage to belt out “I Saw Her Standing There” and “Helter Skelter.” By the time you read this, you’ve probably already seen it on Instagram.With all the hubbub, it was hard to focus on the clothes, or even find them, though perhaps that was also because the gangs of models clustered in the space—SIR Studios, a 50-year-old instrument rental and recording institution—almost disappeared into the set design, like ghosts of the studio’s rock heyday. “I think everything I do will probably, without me even trying, relate to rock ’n’ roll,” McCartney explained. That came through in a series of experiments with an old favorite: animal prints, for both men and women—blown up on fuzzy knitwear, blurred to look like camouflage, or layered over houndstooth checks. This was only the second time McCartney has shown her men’s and women’s collections together, and the format was underscored by another prominent work of neon: a large, flashing Time’s Up logo. “I have two sons and two daughters, and I really just want them to not even know what Time’s Up is,” she said.Both collections also featured zany, graphic pieces in red, black, and white, like zigzag knits and silks, and coats with enormously scaled words woven into the fabric. Elsewhere, a set of deconstructed lace-inset slip dresses in sherbet hues telegraphed a with-the-band dreaminess, while the guys on the opposite side of the stage sported tailoring with a Fab Four feel. The accessories, as per usual, packed plenty of razzle-dazzle, particularly a bag and scarf with a groovy retro graphic readingNo Smile No Service.The other strand in McCartney’s DNA is, of course, her environmentalist bent. This season, in addition to her signature vegan furs and leathers and a special recycled nylon, she’s introducing a more sustainable range of eyewear and a new sneaker for both men and women, the fully recyclable Loop trainer, assembled with tiny internal hooks instead of toxic glue (the on-trend sock knit style also happens to eliminate cutting waste).

But last season, after landing the Emilio Pucci gig, he practiced unfamiliar restraint on his own runway in an effort to separate the two labels. Today, the pendulum swung back, way back. Williamson showed a wildly over-the-top collection for a girl on permanent vacation in Ibiza. Colors were psychedelic, prints were loud, and mirrored sequins glinted. The opening look—coral short shorts and a chambray chemise heavily embroidered with wood and plastic beads—had a bit of the relaxed boho vibe he once favored, but from there he went all-out glam with fluoro brights and kaleidoscopic digital prints on smock dresses, sweater vests, and a bathing suit.In the right time and place—i.e. at 4 a.m. on the dance floor at Pacha—some of it could work, the lily pad-print sleeveless minidress, for example.

Balmain,fall-2010-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2010-ready-to-wear/balmain,"Sober, pared-down minimalism? Well, somebody has to kick against it, and there's no more likely a candidate to keep hot and sexy alive than Christophe Decarnin. This season, he's gone Baroque 'n' roll, with a Balmain outing pitched somewhere between Prince'sPurple Rainpomp and Louis XIV at Versailles. Gold, brocade, frock coats, Louis-heeled ribbon-laced boots, sequin and lamé dresses galore: Decarnin went for it.Clever move, on lots of levels. For one thing, shifting Balmain away from the distressedMASH-militaria of summer to a classier, dressier theme puts this notoriously expensive collection on a path where the value of the original can be clearly distinguished from the cheap knockoff. This show's highly elaborate, high-collared seventeenth-century cutaway coats and gilded jeans did that. From a cutting-expertise point of view, so did Decarnin's seventies/nineties tailored pantsuits, which showcased the return of the leg-lengthening, over-shoe flared pant. The idea, the designer said, came to him while looking at a seventies photo of a woman ""in an impeccable Balmain couture menswear pantsuit,"" but the spirit was closer to the Tom Ford for Gucci look that is rising as part of the nineties redux theme of the season.Still, those gold-buttoned pinstripes (albeit with a gold Lurex stripe, in one case) were the closest this collection's ever likely to come to workwear. Really, what the Balmain woman's hooked on is the competitive evening opportunity to flash as much leg and bosom as possible. She'll be thrilled to see there's no wavering in that department. Decarnin's short and tight paillette-smothered dresses kept the faith with the big-shouldered silhouette he's made a signature for several seasons—actually, one too many.

That makes news, especially at the shrine to men's fashion that is Pitti Uomo, where Pompilio has been showing for seasons, ever since winning Pitti andVogue Italia's Who's on Next award. Backstage, Pompilio said he was just giving the people what they want. ""They ask so many times for very petite sizes for women, so why not do it?"" he asked. ""Taking something for men and making it more female for woman."" In return, it seemed, the women gave something more female to the men. Pompilio has never shied away from full-plumage colors, but the baby pink topcoats and flat-front pants he showed for men suggested a trade agreement between the sexes. So did the men's shoes, slip-on mocs tufted with puffs of fur. The girls, by contrast, had lug-soled lace-ups.

Erdem,resort-2011,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2011/erdem,"Aiming squarely at America, his biggest market, Erdem Moralioglu made versatility the heart of his resort collection. He imagined his outfits broken down and recombined to create ""a beautiful, logical uniform."" Winningly straightforward drop-waisted shifts, sleeveless poplin tops, and shirtdresses were center stage. They reminded the designer of the sixties (Samantha Stevens in her subdivision, perhaps), but he gave them an edge with murky, ominous prints that abstracted and combined flowers and static electricity. ""Gothic suburban?"" he offered with a dry laugh.Moralioglu also wanted to emphasize seasonlessness and ""occasionlessness."" He saw everything—even the little summer shorts—making an easy transition from a lunch date to a night at the opera.

Alexis Mabille,spring-2020-couture,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2020-couture/alexis-mabille,"Dita Von Teese opened Alexis Mabille’s couture show today, slowly descending from a grand staircase at Sotheby’s Paris headquarters, which was transformed for the occasion into a chic salon. Dressed glamorously—and rather demurely by her standards—in a shimmering sequined tuxedo, she was the only black swan in a défilé populated by white-clad creatures.Mabille called it Carte Blanche. “I had a feel for purity freed from color; it was almost as if working on the toile during anessayage,” he explained, referring to the white-canvas patterns that seamstresses usually make to test the shape of a dress. White gave him a sort of clean slate to highlight every dress’s design and structure. He played the full couture repertoire: the mastery of draping and cutting; the exquisiteness of details; the layering of featherlight textures in different nuances of white—fromcrème fraîcheto optical. It was a sort of virtuoso exercise on the very Parisianésprit de couture.Every look was rather individual, as is customary in many collections today. What made the show cohesive, beyond the choice of white as the non-color, was Mabille’s very flirty, seductive approach. “I was inspired by the divine Jacqueline de Ribes,” he explained. One of the great society ladies, the viscountess is still the epitome of allure and charisma. Her aristocratic profile and fabulous fashion sense has graced more designer mood boards than can be counted.A fierce sense of individuality is a rather French attribute, so the designer riffed on it rather effortlessly in the collection, working on varied silhouettes for his many clients. “They all possess what I call‘l’intelligence du look’(the cleverness of the look),” he explained. “They never wear a look the first-degree way; they always add their own personal twist.” His women are obviously fond of real jewels (“They don’t do costume jewelry,” he underlined); and Sotheby’s was gracious enough to lend fabulous vintage jewelry from its upcoming April auction to be worn in the show. The jewels accessorized  layered laces veiled with sensuous mousseline, and the many corseted numbers that the designer described as “slightly bondage-y, but romantic and comfortable.”Well, comfort wasn’t the first thing that came to mind when a model twirled on the catwalk wearing a fitted bustier dress shrouded in anuageof tulle and lace. And even if an all-white collection immediately evokes a rather obvious bridal approach, who would walk the aisle dressed in a trompe l’oeil asymmetrical sheath, kept in place only by a flirty bow that left almost half the body completely exposed?

Area,pre-fall-2022,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2022/area,"The internet has recently become fascinated with an AI image generator called Dall-E mini. The web application takes text input and translates it into a spooky, impressionist rendering of whatever your mind can dream up. It’s a tool Area’s Piotrek Panszczyk could do wonders with, at least if his pre-fall collection is any measure. Here, in images by Collier Schorr styled by Katie Burnett, he delivers Dua Lipa meets Marie Curie in the Garden of Eden, Hubert de Givenchy by way of harajuku flowers, and Edwige Bellmore via Emma Corrin, among other conflicting and contrasting moods.Flora and fauna were Panszczyk’s most obvious starting point, taking hot pink duchesse satin and creating static floral poufs that could be sized up or down to create a crop top and mini skirt or an entrancing dress. Flowers also appear as spiked crystal tops and pasties, as sunglasses, as earrings, and as crystal pants that wind up the legs. Since Area’s last collection, its showgirl potential has become more fully realized; these experiments in fluttering crystal seem destined for Beyoncé, Olivia Rodrigo, Precious Lee, or any of the other larger-than-life women that swear by the brand’s devilishly saccharine clothes.Careful to not give it all away in a pre-collection, Panszczyk has balanced it out with sharpened tailoring in black, white, and brown houndstooth boasting crystal trim, as well as an extended, Alaïa-esque section of leopard print pouf skirts and teensy bustiers. You could chasen him for borrowing so readily from other designer’s oeuvres if it was exactly how so many others of his generation work without ever acknowledging the reference or working to modify it to a current woman’s fixations.The disparate harmony of a blazers-to-pasties collection is justified by the Area books.

Naeem Khan,spring-2018-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2018-ready-to-wear/naeem-khan,"Oh, the drama! Naeem Khan is never one for subtlety, and this season was about pumping up the volume even more on his opulent designs. The Spring collection came with a ton of looks on the runway, though Khan said backstage that he originally had upwards of 130 pieces that he’d struggled to edit down. It was all part of the show, however, one that featured aSwan Lake–esque set with a fog machine and pounding music. In the front row, the always-fabulous Paula Abdul smiled and bobbed her head to the beat. Just down the row was formerLaguna Beachstar Kristin Cavallari. Now these may seem like odd bedfellows to find at a fashion show, but in a way they represent the spectrum of women who buy Khan’s clothes in the first place: the established icon who likes to try on a daring red carpet gown and the young, successful Hollywood personality who needs pretty bejeweled dresses for galas and hosting events.This time around, Khan showed clothes for both of those customers and more.

At a fittings appointment pre-show, backstage in the Senegalese capital’s former Palais de Justice (now home to its art Biennale), Virginie Viard said that the idea first took hold three years ago.

The first stop post-arrival was on Gorée island, just offshore from the city, a place that was once a hub of the African slave trade under colonial rule and which is now a monument. There was a visit to the studio of sculptor Ousman Sowe, a tour of local artisan markets and an art-filled medina, and a “literary rendezvous” between Marie NDiaye, Charlotte Casiraghi, and Rokhaya Niang (alongside a performance by rapper Nix), plus a stop to see the beautiful furniture design of Ousmane Mbaye.

""He's one of my favorite designers,"" Posen said of the legendary James. ""This collection came down to exactly what he was about: focusing on a level of discipline and craft.""To emphasize his refreshed attention to good, clean work that shows off his abilities in draping, pleating, and overall garment construction, Posen presented just 25 looks. To start, there were seamed skirtsuits in mélange tweed. The construction was precise, although the hem of the skirts might've been taken down an inch or two for slightly more modern proportions. There were also day dresses—most notably a blue mélange tweed style with a mini cape that curved around the arms beautifully—as well as black double-face wool coats with voluminous backs that added the good kind of drama. But it was really about the gowns. The narrow, off-the-shoulder style with architectural flutter sleeves in stretchy rose-colored duchesse satin felt youthful and alive. The strapless seafoam green number, with a skirt so wide it grazed knees on both sides of the aisle, proved that extreme volume can be done without looking garish.

(They also came high-waisted with suspenders.)Velvet spilled over suit jackets in the form of hoods, or peeked out from underneath in jewel-toned frog-closed waistcoats. Shirts were printed with velvet roses; blazers came in velvet tweed, plaid, or a faded argyle. There was even a pair of shoes in herringbone-patterned velvet. The fabric loaned itself well to Armani's favored color scheme of mushrooms, taupes, and heathery grays, and it was the perfect complement to the gentle tailoring that is also his signature. (Crepe-soled shoes underscored the comfort factor.)After a while though, a body began to yearn for a little structure. Just in time, an overcoat in double-faced cashmere came as a blessed relief from the soft parade. As for the eccentric twists we have come to expect from Armani of late, asauvagecollar-less fur coat, a silver weekend bag, and crimson suede slip-ons caught the eye.

A pandemic, a devastating explosion in his native Beirut, his country’s subsequent financial collapse, and now war in Europe—none of them were going to stop the Lebanese couturier from showing his ready-to-wear collection to a crowd of adoring clients, plus assembled press and buyers. The front row was loaded with the professionally sleek—Toni Garrn, Lais Ribeiro with her basketballer fiancé Joakim Noah, and Coco Rocha—and the catwalk boasted their one-time Victoria’s Secret colleague Cindy Bruna. They whooped as she sashayed past in a skin-tight black dress trimmed with sequined ruffles.Backstage, Mr. Saab said he felt like “it was time” for a catwalk show, which was a much bigger affair than his couture presentation in January. “It’s been two years of suffering,” he said, before he was interrupted by Olivia Palermo, a coterie of well-wishers in her wake. The collection was an A to Z of his greatest hits: glamorous evening dresses with elegant caped shoulders, rhinestone-spangled LBDs, heavily embroidered sheer gowns with accordion pleats. A little more adventurous were the sequin- and feather-strewn bomber jackets paired with black mini dresses and styled with heavy, lug-soled boots rather than the requisite skyscrapers. He even sent out a hoodie, albeit a giant green taffeta one. “It’s about strong women, strong characters, a little rock ‘n’ roll,” he said.Despite everything, the business is ticking along.

Elie Saab,pre-fall-2023,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2023/elie-saab,"Elie Saab took a break from prepping his upcoming couture show to Zoom about his pre-fall lineup. On paper, these categories of fashion are about as far apart as possible. Being custom, couture is the most individual form of dressmaking; because the pre-collection sits the longest on the selling floor, its appeal must be a bit broader. Saab’s aim, however, was to build a kind of bridge between the two—to bring a “couture touch” to ready-to-wear.This was the most convincing daywear I’ve seen from Saab maybe because he skipped any references to focus on the basics: color, shape, fabric. Most surprising was the designer’s choice to work with scuba fabrics and it paid off in the form of a red, floral appliqué dinner dress with a pretty portrait neckline and the “hug”-like fit typical of the material.Sophistication was what Saab was after, and he achieved it in terms of palette, by focusing on “recherche” grenadine rather than red, for example.

Ganni,copenhagen-fall-2021,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/copenhagen-fall-2021/ganni,"Growing up in a small town in Denmark, Ganni’s creative director, Ditte Reffstrup, says MTV was her only source for pop culture and style. “There were no magazines, but there was MTV,” she saidback in 2019. “My window to the U.S. was Madonna.” Reffstrup has been deeply passionate about music ever since, seeing it not just as a medium that shaped her identity, but one that represents connectivity and community too. Throughout lockdown, it’s where she turned for inspiration and to boost her mood, often with the ’90s hits she remembers from her youth. Of course, attending a concert would’ve been ideal—so for fall 2021, she and her husband Nicolaj, Ganni’s founder, staged one of their own.The digital experience, “Love Forever,” isn’t another video of models dancing awkwardly to a canned playlist. It includes real performances by Zsela, Deb Never, and Coco O., and will stream today on YouTube and Ganni’s Instagram. After a year of virtual shows, it’s surprising how few designers have done something similar; a virtual concert is more likely to engage young shoppers like Ganni’s than a prerecorded show or a moody fashion film. They’ll be excited to discover new music in addition to the new collection.On that note, Reffstrup said she was thinking about what artists wear onstage—clothes that have an immediate impact and read well on a screen. On a Zoom call, she pointed out a jacket in a hi-def emerald green (she joked it was the exact shade of Kermit the Frog) and a few moments of flash, like a metallic-coated denim vest and matching jeans with curvy legs. Elsewhere, Ganni-isms like lean dresses, boxy suits, and statement collars were simply tweaked with new, voluminous proportions or odd textures. The once ruffly collars shrank a bit with newly sharp edges, and a Gen Z–friendly skirt set came in puffy quilted brown leather.Much of it will feel familiar to the #GanniGirl, which was intentional; Reffstrup isn’t looking to challenge her with new trends or unrealistic shapes right now. Like Reffstrup’s favorite ’80s and ’90s albums, these clothes are meant to be moments of uplift and small reminders that better days (and IRL concerts!) are coming. “It’s this feeling that we aren’t alone in the world,” she said. “It’s a collection full of optimism.”",Emily Farra,"February 4, 2021","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/601c137bbca94120cab61499/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-Ganni-Fall-21.jpg",copenhagen,fall,2021,other,2020,Ditte Reffstrup,,,"Growing up in a small town in Denmark , Ganni ’s creative director , , says was her only source for pop culture and style . “ There were no magazines , but there was , ” she saidback in 2019 . “ My window to the U.S. was . ” Reffstrup has been deeply passionate about music ever since , seeing it not just as a medium that shaped her identity , but one that represents connectivity and community too .

Balenciaga,spring-2023-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2023-ready-to-wear/balenciaga,"Optimism is a word we’ve heard over and over again this season. With rare exceptions designers have put on their blinders and decided it’s their job to help us shrug off the world’s sorrows and shop our despair away. Not Balenciaga’s Demna. Rising inequality, the return of fascism, the very real threat of nuclear war. He laid it all out at his post-apocalyptic show today, trying, I think, to shake us awake.Backstage he called the show a companion piece to last season. When snow melts it turns to mud, and there were literally tons of mud today, piled up at the sides of the stadium space, and dug out like bomb craters in the center, staged by the Spanish artist Santiago Sierra. The raw odeur of decomposition, a custom-made scent by Demna’s frequent collaborator Sissel Tolaas, blasted us in the face.Kanye West opened the show in a tactical jacket and leather pants with reinforced knees, military garb topped off with a baseball cap and a logo mouthguard. The ragtag band that followed was rough around the edges to say the least, their faces beat-up (hours in the makeup chair) and their clothes treated to look old and beat-up too (requiring a “couple of days” more than making pristine luxury, Demna said). Some carried bags made from stuffed animals that looked like they’d been through a war. When the 75 models made their circuit on the wet track, dirt splashed their bare ankles and soaked their hems, the 3-D printed Dutch clogs being no match for the mud.Demna has had his own experience of war—he fled Georgia with his family when he was a young boy of 10. Being gay compounded his struggles. “I’ve felt like I’ve been punched in my face for being who I am,” he said, but “you have to stand up and continue walking, kind of like this crusade of discovering who you are and defending that.” He called this a “very me show.”It was heavy on grafitti’d hoodies and ravaged jeans, but there was also evening wear, in clingy T-shirt jersey or glamorous pleats. These were survivors against the odds, a point Demna made by sending out men clutching baby carriers propped with eerily lifelike dolls. “Naturally I’m an optimist, but I cannot be very optimistic right now,” he said. “I think this show actually expresses that very much—the music, the set, it spoke about the moment in which we live.” The soundtrack by BFRND was actually quite terrifying.To finish, Demna sent out a dress made from cut-up parts of black Balenciaga Lariat bags, a make-do-and-mend masterpiece that also pointed up our nasty overconsumption habits. Remember, he sent every last piece through the mud, a “sacrilege” by luxury standards. Using fashion to comment on the crises that plague us is a tricky business. Of course Demna wants us to shop, and of course his bosses do, too.

Chloé,fall-2022-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2022-ready-to-wear/chloe,"“We think about the climate crisis, we’re able to see the climate crisis,” Gabriela Hearst declared. “But now it’s time to start visualizing climate success. And there are many ways of doing it. Rewilding is one of them.”More than any other high-fashion designer, except for Stella McCartney, Hearst invites discussion, inspection, even, of how she sources her materials—both for her own brand in New York, and here at Chloé in Paris. Which meant that a fundamental divergence between the positions of these two climate-activist fashion designers opened up at the beginning of the show. Here there was leather. A lot of it. Not “vegan leather” or any of its fruit or mushroom substitutes, or its fossil fuel-derived polyester lookalikes (as used, variously, by McCartney), but actual glossy leather-leather. Made from the hides of cattle.“For me, leather is a by-product of the meat industry,” Hearst said in a preview. “So, as long as you know where it’s coming from, and you have traceability and it’s done in a proper way, you’re using waste.” Her leather comes from Italian suppliers, whose tanning processes are compliant with European environmental standards.Over to how the overture to the collection looked: strict, minimal, black, brown and yellowy-tan leather pieces, ranging from coats to shirts to narrow jeans—with an of-the-moment white tank tee—and a belted black dress with balloon sleeves. The show hewed between boy-tailored pant suits, fit-and-flare dresses, and Hearst’s characteristic affinity for ponchos and knitwear—and for searching out links with socially-responsible textile projects.The latest is her commissioning of the African-American Gee’s Bend women quilters of Alabama. The storied artist community used Chloé deadstock scraps to fashion blankets and the gilet layered over a coat worn as the finale by Amber Valletta.Back to Hearst’s primary resolve to message hopeful solutions in the face of climate anxiety. She’d sought out the advice of Isabella Tree, the British environmentalist who returned her farmland in Sussex to nature. Leaving it to its own devices—“Rewilding”—has scientifically proved how ecosystems, plants, insects, birds, and soil will start healing themselves of their own accord, in balance with the benefits brought by grazing animals. Hearst relates to that, through her own experience of being brought up on her mother’s ranch in Uruguay. “My mom’s place is full of wildlife, because she never overgrazes, so it’s regenerative,” she said. “When people talk about regenerative agriculture, I know it firsthand.”On the runway, Hearst wanted to materialize the hope that damage can be reversed. She did it with recycled cashmere knitted sweaters and skirts. On the front were instarsia images of melted glaciers, arid and burning landscapes. On the reverse: pictures of green mountain ranges, forests and polar bears. If only humans can imagine that, she believes, we can make it happen.",Sarah Mower,"March 3, 2022","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6220ee588e14ca9d1f5358aa/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-chloe-fall-2022-ready-to-wear-paris-credit-filippo-fior-gorunway.jpg",,fall,2022,ready-to-wear,2020,Gabriela Hearst,1976.0,,"“ We think about the climate crisis , we ’re able to see the climate crisis , ” declared . “ But now it ’s time to start visualizing climate success .

John Varvatos,spring-2008-menswear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2008-menswear/john-varvatos,"The key to John Varvatos' fashion sensibility might be found in the last outfit that made its way down his catwalk: a tuxedo jacket and jeans. It's a quintessential dressed-up-rocker combo, the sort of thing that a Varvatos fave like Jesse Malin (front-row center, in a painful-looking neck-and-back brace arrangement) might wear to an awards show. Perhaps he'd even tie a silky scarf around his waist, the way Varvatos showed it. The designer made his mark with collections that delivered American frontier spirit with European finesse, and he's gone on honing that proposition (the set—a collage of dusty, cracked old window frames—simultaneously suggested a Wild West ghost town and abandoned buildings in the Eastern bloc). His latest standouts included a fitted, zippered jacket that bloused in the back, a mushroom-toned military jacket, and a slate cotton tux.

Marchesa,spring-2011-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2011-ready-to-wear/marchesa,"There were times today at Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig's Marchesa presentation when you couldn't breathe. And it had nothing to do with the crush of onlookers, camera crews, celebrity journalists, or the mini-posses of handlers for Jessica Szohr, Kelly Osbourne, and Gabourey Sidibe. Or, quite frankly, even with the baying pack of paparazzi laid in wait for them outside the Chelsea Art Museum.Nope, it was the dresses—literally breathtaking—all exquisitely wrought this season with orientalist-inspired details: heavily bejeweled necklines, hand-painted florals on rolling sculptural drapes, and grand obilike loops that were revealed when a model turned. Amid the gowns were a few harem-panted jumpsuits. Cut in lace and finished with little bolero jackets and jewel-crusted clutches, they didn't exactly read casual.Chapman and Craig have proved time and again they know how to knock them dead.

Johanna Ortiz,spring-2024-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2024-ready-to-wear/johanna-ortiz,"For spring Johanna Ortiz headed West. “I’ve always been an equestrian,” she explained on a Zoom from the Paris showroom where she was holding appointments. “That’s where we started this season.” There were Western-jacket motifs on a long cream cotton jacket with a wrap belt at the waist and delicately pin-tucked details throughout that made the fabric appear as it was a tonal stripe. It was also used on a tobacco brown linen jacket with a tonal floral-esque insignia made from woven raffia that had been patchworked in the back, like a marker of a cool club. A similar patchwork treatment featured on a black maxi skirt—the patchwork in raffia’s more natural coloring instead—worn with a voluminous off-the shoulder cotton shirtRaffia played a starring role in the collection, something that Ortiz often returns to season after season, though spring found her hitting a particularly magnificent sweet spot. Take the ecru cotton dress with a dynamic checker print; towards the hem, a row of fringe turned out to be little rolls of it woven into the fabric and adding a wonderful element of movement—if not magic. A similar technique was used on the bodice of an elegant black and ecru number where 18 strands of raffia, left fringed on either end, marked a sort of classic line on a bustier. On another dress they formed an intricately woven fan shape that rippled into rows of ruffles across a slim skirt. The simplicity of the shape combined with the humble materials created elegantly pared-back evening solutions.Elsewhere, Ortiz’s restrained (but never quiet) elegance could be summed up by two looks: one, a black bodysuit with a deep-V back, paired with a low-slung embroidered cotton voile skirt in black and tobacco brown, accessorized with a thin leather belt with a silver clasp. Another took the two-piece approach of the look and simplified it even further, converting it into a dress with a black tank top whose dropped waist merged into the lace fabric (this time in black and white). Naturally, both styles had pockets. “It’s a perfect summer dress, and the fabric feels a little bit silky—almost like a voile,” Ortiz said. “I think it really shows my love for textiles, and that’s how everything starts in our collection. A passion for textiles, for prints, for textures, and trying to give comfortable-yet-luxurious fabrics that make women feel good in their body.” What else could one ask for?",Laia Garcia-Furtado,"October 3, 2023","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/651a8243bf614ae9806e4f0d/master/w_1280,c_limit/00001-johanna-ortiz-spring-2024-ready-to-wear-credit-brand.jpg",,spring,2024,ready-to-wear,2020,,,,"For spring headed West . “ I ’ve always been an equestrian , ” she explained on a Zoom from the Paris showroom where she was holding appointments . “ That ’s where we started this season . ” There were Western - jacket motifs on a long cream cotton jacket with a wrap belt at the waist and delicately pin - tucked details throughout that made the fabric appear as it was a tonal stripe .

Certainly nothing of the functional, waterproof variety. Their vision for Fall was a departure, billed as “opulence meets outdoors.” That mostly played out in unlikely contrasts: a glen plaid blazer cinched with a bungee cord belt; a brown leather boilersuit teamed with ladylike kitten heels; a fuzzy check “shacket,” or shirt-jacket, thrown over a pencil skirt; a camouflage fleece quarter-zip tucked into a flowery skirt.If a few of those mash-ups felt a bit effortful—particularly in a week that’s seen a return to elegant, relaxed, non-maximalist daywear—the Veronicas’ big achievement was in the pieces that will genuinely surprise their customer. Perhaps that’s why a top buying team had raved about the collection, according to Swanson Beard; she said they’d been into the “uptown-meets-upstate” vibe.

It’s not that she shared any revelatory backstory to herSacaiResort collection, which pretty much hewed to her signature mastery of opposites attract. Her presence simply helped form a closer association between character and craft. Abe had every reason to be proud of her homage to a crochet quilt; its colorful patchwork arrangement had been printed atop lace so that, from a distance, the openwork could have been either. As a poncho broken up by denim, the treatment was unpretentious and ingenious. In a similar vein, only upon close inspection might you discover hibiscus flowers embedded within a grid of lace. The collection was ripe with other randomness: trimmings borrowed from Afghan embroidery, smocked dresses in denim paisley jacquard punctuated with pineapples, and woven Mexican blankets turned into a parka. Abe blithely chalked up this mélange to the freedom that comes with designing in modern times.She reiterated that new ideas frequently materialize from what she would want to wear; as in, why settle for a classic tweed suit when you could transform it into a sporty minidress lined with a tuft of lace, or piece together a funky kilt? Women won’t need much persuading here. Abe duly drew attention to a hickory stripe jacket, pointing out that the material was uncut velvet—an uncommon material disguised as common workwear.

Christopher Esber,fall-2024-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2024-ready-to-wear/christopher-esber,"For both pre-fall and fall 2024, Christopher Esber is exploring the different facets of nostalgia.“I wanted to create this idea of summer past and present for day-to-evening and also express the idea of erosion and decay in textiles,” he explained via Zoom from his studio in Sydney. That translated into some compelling plays on texture, for example in pleated, crushed viscose (one of several sustainable materials here) and what he described as a “grittier” take on the endless-sunshine lifestyle that’s usually associated with Australian fashion brands.The designer also tapped into a 1970s-inspired “mood ring” vibe. Highlights from the pre-fall collection included a colorful, watery “aura” print on a metal glo-mesh dress and skirt, thermo-sensitive resin pebbles on a dress that changes hues with body heat and other heat-sensitive materials that gave jersey tees or outerwear an added cool factor.Most designers are doing their best to wrest lace into modern wardrobes this season, and Esber gamely rose to the challenge by painting latex onto French lace, or pairing lace with suede, ribbing, or flip-flop jellies in recycled rubber. “I’m always really fascinated by things that aren't what they seem, that feel different,” he said.In terms of tailoring, the designer ventured into fresh territory. A skirt suit with cigar-colored suede trim was one example of his approach to more structured silhouettes. A boxier khaki blazer looked like a winner, and a blue jacket shown here had a T-bar cutout under a trench-style back, “a bit of ventilation without exposure,” Esber offered.In his main fall collection, Esber continued his musings about heirlooms, giving outsized volumes to a white cashmere coat informed by the idea of repurposing vintage fur, or a shaggy coat in looped merino knit. The notion of jewelry passed down from one generation to the next resulted in a jewel print on a hoodie top, a double belt printed in blue on a sleeveless white dress, and silver piercings along the edge of a black calf hair trench.He also circled back to lace, inspired in part by Nicole Kidman’s opening scene in Eyes Wide Shut, and in part by a wedding dress he recently made for a friend, which involved piecing together swatches of her grandmother's vintage lace.

Giorgio Armani,spring-2013-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2013-ready-to-wear/giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani called his new collection Kaleidoscope, and his evening was appropriately splintered between his show in the Armani Teatro and an exhibition he opened in the space next door. Called Eccentrico, the latter focused on a couple of decades of the designer's most extreme flights of fancy from his ready-to-wear and couture collections. Plus thatStarship Troopersthing he made for Gaga. Armani has often mused on his love of fashion's grand eccentrics. Just as the exhibition betrayed an unlikely debt to Schiaparelli, it also poignantly highlighted Armani's own yearning to be something more than the Emperor of Greige. And maybe it also freed him in some way to focus in his new collection on the best of himself.A kaleidoscope splinters light, and that spacey notion informed Armani's clothes, which took a cue from Eccentrico's deep space setting. The first look—a silvery leather coat over a drawstring top and pants in organza—was oh-so-casual but otherworldly in its sheen. It was all in the fabrics. The kurtalike layering—short jacket over long tunic over pants—may be in the air but it's long been a staple of the Armani design vocabulary, especially in that ineffable silver gray. When color crept in, jade or turquoise, it was abstracted with the gray to evoke a blurry futurism, with the shimmer of distant stars.And there's no one who does the navy of a night sky like Armani. Harking back a couple of years to his Tuareg collection, he draped midnight silks and organzas in languid pajamalike configurations that spoke of an ease so seductive it was almost narcotic. He pushed it more and more as the show's eveningwear approached, trapping constellations and starlight in wide pants, draped tunics, floating skirts, and sheer shawls. Clothes for cosmic dreamers, indeed.And now for the caveat. Armani shows so much in every collection that there are always a few duds drifting by.

No surprise, then, that he comes well prepared to the sustainability conversation: “There’s no profit without ethics. Now they’re all bragging about this concept,” he said.

The Fall collection was proof of the attitude of subtle yet confident evolution that drives Cucinelli’s m.o.—as well as it apparently drives conspicuous sales. The classic soft-tailored, formal-informal blazers were kept nipped-waisted and round-shouldered, but were updated just so, slightly longer than usual and paired with loose-fit trousers.

With her fall lineup, she was after a different effect. Abe is betting on a reemergence return to dressing up, one that will see her clients in elongated, close-to-the-body silhouettes that waft in soft volumes below the knees, often with a statement coat topping off the look. The results are willowy yet tough, a neat trick.The Sacai team recreated Tokyo’s frenetic Shibuya Crossing on a studio lot outside the city, and landed a helicopter in the middle of the intersection that in real life is too thronged with people for such a feat. In the video, models emerge from the helicopter’s side door, parade around it in a group, and watch from the crosswalk when it takes off again. Abe laughed and said she had to reassure her mother that she hadn’t actually bought it. The point was to drive home the urbane nature of the clothes.The hybridizations that define Abe’s Sacai designs continue to be co-opted by other labels, so she keeps on experimenting. This season she played with different size patterns in some cases, and in others mixed masculine and feminine tropes. Layering a smaller jacket over a larger one, as she did in the first exit, produced the puffed line of its shoulders and oversize sleeves. Meanwhile, the fluid look of the collection’s many long skirts was achieved by leaving the side seams of trousers unfinished so that the panels float around the legs below the tighter skirts worn over them.Are Abe’s clients ready to hang up their Sacai x Nike trainers?

After a men's show that was black as black, Prada went pastel for Fall. ""Sweet…,"" said Miuccia, ""but violent. I wanted impact. How can you be strong with pastels?"" The answer was to drench them in irony.She had a couple of working titles for her new collection. ""Softer pop"" was self-explanatory, a riff on the color palette. But ""variation on beauty"" touched on a longtime fascination of Miuccia's: the relationship between the real and the fake. Is beauty created by genetic modification or surgical intervention any less ""real"" than natural beauty? This show set out to address that issue from both ends of the spectrum. Some of the most appealing items in the collection were cut from ostrich, but equally, a molecular print that harked back to Prada's good-/bad-taste glory days was actually an image of genetically modified ostrich. Tweeds came woven and printed. Music from Walt Disney'sFantasiaplayed, as a reminder that images of extreme beauty can spring from absolute artifice. In fact, there was something a bit cartoonish about the pieces cut from a hyper-smooth, spongy sci-fi fabric that most of us took for neoprene. It was actually a double-faced jersey. ""I could do things with that fabric I couldn't do with another fabric,"" Miuccia enthused.One thing she could definitely do was challenge convention in the sly, subversive way that has always been one of the most forceful arguments for Prada's influence. The influence may have waned a little of late—sales have been off—but this show unfolded with the growing sensation that Miuccia was playing once more to her strengths, especially her ability to evoke, then upend, the familiar. What first made her famous, in other words. Opera gloves and fur stoles, brooches and bows, ponytails and kitten heels, Empire lines and pantsuits painted a picture of a Nixon-era debutante. The fact that the stole was abstracted into an attached strip of fur, or the brooches were cut from Perspex, or the gloves were all colors of leather, or the dresses and suits were molded from that peculiar fabric all added up to Prada's Factor X, the acid Miuccia added to her pastel punch.

That was Tomas Maier in the Bottega Veneta showroom today, presenting the label's Resort collection for 2015. Some designers do take a straightforward approach to in-between seasons like Resort and Pre-Fall, but Maier's not one of them. BV's creative director is as intrigued by process as he is by the final product, a fact that his new clothes crystalized.He started with the idea of bleach and how laundering a garment in the stuff can fade it in random ways. Extending that notion, he used a process called corrosion to remove color from pieces in graphic patterns—bleach stripes at the neckline of a crisp cotton shirt, a white floral motif on a lilac top. Other times, the actual substance of a material was changed, as in the case of a dévoré blouse and a jacquard flower-print lamé miniskirt.Maier's trick was that nothing felt contrived. Industrially washed for a faded effect, his knit sweaters were utterly simple, yet completely divine. And that enviable sense of simplicity extended into his evening dresses. No ball gowns or bustiers here, of course. Maier's long dresses are modeled after tank tops and T-shirts. The ease is built right in; the drama comes from the way he corroded and then over-dyed them.

Dior,fall-2024-couture,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2024-couture/christian-dior,"Couture has historically been about “building the body” with its corset foundations and highly structured silhouettes. “But I don’t want to build the body, I want to release it,” Maria Grazia Chiuri said today. That’s as clear a manifesto for Chiuri’s work at Christian Dior as she’s ever uttered, and the reason she is the most modern couturier working today.On the eve of the Paris Olympics, her idea was to recast sportswear through a couture lens. Her very first collection at Dior was dedicated to fencing. Here, she married Ancient Greece, the birthplace of the Olympics, with the 1924 Games, when women were fighting to be taken seriously as athletes and also, thanks to the Industrial Revolution and the invention of jersey fabric, adopting new forms of dress better adapted to the movements required for sports. She called out Alice Milliat, a rower whose tireless advocacy helped get women’s track and field competitions into the 1928 Olympics.We take for granted now the comfort of jog bras and leggings, but 100 years ago we were still wearing corsets to ride bikes. It’s puzzling that corsets and constraint are still such common sights in the highest echelons of clothes making. In this regard, at least, couture earns its long held reputation as the old-world, even dusty, part of the fashion business. But not Chiuri’s Dior.She returned to the peplos, a traditional draped garment Dior himself cut in chiffon; Chiuri pointed to a ravishing photograph of just such a dress from 1948. Hers were constructed in silk jersey or metal jersey, and instead of anchoring them to a corset, she used embroidered tank tops and bodysuits that utterly changed the attitude. Though they remained formal, they looked free, a quality enhanced by the models’ strappy skimmer sandals. Maybe you couldn’t wear them for the high jump—one of the track and field competitions added in 1928—but I bet you could throw the javelin, a sport that was only added to official competition later.“Couture gives me the opportunity to move these references, our heritage, into new territory,” Chiuri said. “Wellness, comfort, and beauty—I think these three elements are very important in our work. But sometimes fashion is more obsessed with the silhouette or the construction than the material. I want to do clothes where the body stays well, and can move freely.”Pantsuits in white moiré and black velvet with a peplos suspended from the waistband of the trousers caught some of that relaxed but still polished vibe, as did a day dress in black silk cady with a hand-scalloped bib.

I want to do clothes where the body stays well , and can move freely . ”Pantsuits in white moiré and black velvet with a peplos suspended from the waistband of the trousers caught some of that relaxed but still polished vibe , as did a day dress in black silk cady with a hand - scalloped bib .

Givenchy,fall-2010-ready-to-wear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2010-ready-to-wear/givenchy,"""I was thinking of the ski world, and the scuba world,"" said Riccardo Tisci. ""And the colors of the Bauhaus."" True, his collection incorporated snowflake-patterned knits; neoprene diving fabric; and black, red, and beige as a color code. But the way he melded those materials into his collection spoke more of this Fall's reworking of the aesthetics of the nineties, personalized with Tisci's taste for high-drama Parisian glamour. Sporty piste- cum surfwear this definitely was not.A better way of looking at it was as one of the season's rechannelings of the work of Helmut Lang and Martin Margiela, two towering heroes of modern fashion design whose retirement from the scene has left a gaping hole in women's wardrobes. Tisci's tailoring, like Phoebe Philo's at Celine, is a way of filling that gap with sharp camel coats, tuxedo suits, and lean black pants. In Tisci's case, it's also accompanied by tape-bound throats; red glitter gloves, bags, and lips; and sexy workings of scarlet, black, and nude lace. That's all fully in line with his own gothic taste but also reminiscent of Margiela's styling, back in the long-lost day when ""edgy"" was the buzzword of the nineties.The scuba-ski dynamic meant traditional alpine patterns reengineered into formfitting bodysuits, sunk into neoprene lower garments that unfurled at the waist by means of zippers (the look happens to cross-reference with a section of Nicolas Ghesquière's collection this Fall). For evening, the fold-down device was transposed to inform the shape of black velvet and satin evening shifts and tunics. To end with, Tisci returned to working with feathers—a feature he's made his own in his couture collections over several seasons.

Elie Saab,fall-2019-couture,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2019-couture/elie-saab,"As guests were taking their seats, ambient music gave some indication that Elie Saab had looked to China, or Asia more broadly, for inspiration. This was confirmed from the first look, with gowns moving through harmonies of construction and craftsmanship that conjured empresses and women of high rank displaying their beauty and influence.Richly jewel-toned in velvet and satin, or else ethereally light in satin or tulle, the silhouettes were all manner of ceremonial, romantic, and regal. There were floor-sweeping trains and thigh-high slits; peaked shoulders and one-shoulders; kimono sleeves and cape sleeves; enveloping robes and stricter columns. The embroideries were exceedingly lavish, suggesting auspicious flora and fauna but more abstract than figurative, as though rendered in movement, as well as tracery patterns that would be found on royal garments. There were also a number of dresses whose surfaces displayed not a single sequin or bead; most certainly, these will be well received for existing outside the theme.In the collection notes, Saab is quoted as saying, “I was drawn to East Asia’s rich culture, and the more I let my mind dive into it, the more I explored imperial volumes within the collection, using signature touches that remain true to the Maison.” Waist emphasis qualifies as one of those signature touches: This season, more often than not, the dresses were enhanced with belts comprised of contoured golden discs.Meanwhile, the soundtrack largely toggled between Thom Yorke and Ryuichi Sakamoto, underscoring the contemporary East-West trope that, for whatever reason, proves endlessly alluring in fashion and beyond. Apart from hair and makeup that played up a more caricatured look, this sumptuously executed collection treated the traditional elements with artistic respect.

Miu Miu,pre-fall-2016,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2016/miu-miu,"We trooped into the ParisMiu Miustore to seeMiuccia Prada’s Pre-Fall collection, and there was something nice about that. Seeing a little, non-pretentious show of girls walking in front of us, on carpet, felt like something out of the olden days, long before we were born, when shops and department stores hired local models to parade the latest fashions to the good customers of the county. Between the sensible tailored knickerbocker suits and the high-belted ’70s coats, there was a reassuring air of throwback-ness about the clothes, too—not necessarily because of their historic reference points, but because everything about them was so recognizably Miu Miu–toned to the core.Sometimes there can be too much rushing on from one thing to another in fashion, and far too much artistic philosophizing—so this time it was refreshing to see Miuccia Prada dispense with all that, and just get on with showing the depth and breadth of product Miu Miu offers. Working upwards from the foot, it might involve the following: baroque brocade ballet slippers decorated with punkish leather straps and buckles and a couple of bars of glitter, tied with crisscross ribbons around the ankles of a pair of thick gray ribbed hiking socks, worn under a floral A-line midi dress, which comes layered over a sweater, and then has a coat on top, a checkered cashmere scarf, and the finishing touch of a pair of dangly diamanté earrings. That might not be a literal description of a single outfit, but you get the drift: The more you looked, the more desirable the layerings became—the emerald green corduroy coat, the plum and bottle green velvet platform ankle boots, the cream smock with the frilly yoke, the knitted cape, the poisonous purple balloon-sleeved guipure lace dress, the almost “pre-worn” tote bags several girls were carrying, as if they’d had them forever.Truthfully, there is no great narrative to relate about these clothes—or if there is, Miuccia Prada wasn’t there to tell it. All there is to say is that she did away with the costs of hiring a venue and an architect to build a set this season, and thereby let us concentrate all our attention on the many merits of her clothes and accessories.

Giorgio Armani,fall-2015-menswear,https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2015-menswear/giorgio-armani,"Couples strolled Armani's catwalk today, hardly a new thing for the designer, but he'd called his new collection Romance, which did rather put one in mind of woosome twosomes. Except that the romance in this collection was actually between Giorgio and menswear. He was looking for ""the essence of male beauty,"" a noble fashion quest. And the measure of its success was that you could say in all honesty that the men looked just that:beautiful.If luxury has a cloth and a color, it may well be the deep pile velvet in a shade of mushroom (is that better than greige?) from which Armani cut a jacket in his latest collection. There were crocodile and vicuña too, but Armani's velvets have a life of their own, speaking to a state of mind that cares nothing for utility and everything for indulgence. The extreme softness of these clothes—and of the Emporio Armani collection the other day—was about cosseting, not challenge. Paradoxical, really, when you think that Armani built his empire on a dismissal of fantasy, an embrace of the real. But you could allow him a reflective change of heart in this late-period collection (the man is 80 years old, after all, and the business is turning 40). Those velvets evoked the soft, sheeny Art Deco fantasias of the Hollywood he loved as a child. And there was something of that in the silhouettes too: the trousers tapering from pleated volume at the waist to a narrow ankle, the jackets fitted and three-buttoned.After all this time, Armani is still experimenting with silhouette, like his hybrid of blazer and blouson. But equally, it is memory that sustains and shapes his design sensibility. This was a silver-screen glamorous collection. The eyes of the models were shaded like Valentino's (Rudolph, not Garavani). There were fur scarves, even a stole, to add texture to the luxe. Armani also made room for another romance: his love affair with his hometown. The gray of stone, the brown of brick, and the dark green of Milanese moss colored the clothes.

The fact that she loosened up her silhouette more than ever before, and pushed the draping, is merely sweet synchronicity.
